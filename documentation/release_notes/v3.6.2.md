# Release Notes v3.6.2


## Bugfixes

 - #768 Restored erroneously deleted sqw/dnd methods replicate and sqw method run_inspector. Added unit tests for these methods. 
 - #771 Fixed the issue, causing inability to set up instrument and sample on large filebased sqw files, as the algorithm
        was trying to load all pixel data in memory
 - #780 Fixed Tobyfit not working on recently generated sqw files. The Tobyfit was assuming that all pixel indexes run numbers are 
        enumerated from 1 to the number of data headers, while in fact recent sqw files contain actual run number.
 - #781 Fixed bug in spaghetti plot. The routine was failing.
 - #782 Complex synchronization bug has been fixed in `combine_sqw.mex` code. For some types of pixel data it was causing
        loss of combined pixels and incorrect sqw file as the result.
