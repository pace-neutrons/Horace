## Release Notes v4.1.1

# Highlights
 - #896 a-c Updated mex code is enabled for binning pixels. Horace-3 was using mex code for 
    binning pixels in some algorithms. Horace-4 has substantially refactored these algorithms 
    and disabled mex code. As a result, the algorithms (e.g. cut) which were completely IO bound
    in Horace-3,have taken 60% of its time in MATLAB calculations in Horace-4. This ticket partially 
    solves this issue, updates and modifies `bin_pixels` code to run in all cases where MATLAB code
    is used if mex code is enabled and makes majority of Horace algorithms which use `bin_pixels`
    algorithm IO-speed constrained again.

## Bugs fixed and code improvements:

 - #1904 Fixed incorrect treatment of [-inf,inf] cut limits when corresponding direction 
    in the original file is described by projection axis. Resulting cut ranges were
    incorrectly reduced by half of original binning step in each direction.
 - #1848 `symmetrize_sqw` now can work with rotational symmetry operations.
    To achieve that, algorithm which calculates transformation ranges when 
    `sqw` transformation during `sqw` generation is provided was modified. In addition to that, 
    the algorithm to generate `sqw` objects when transformation is present 
    has to be modified too. This fixed bugs and improve the efficiency of this
    algorithm eliminating expensive unnecessary binning within intermediate boundaries.
    The resulting routine works faster and does not cuts-off unnecessary pixels.
