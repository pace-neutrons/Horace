## Release Notes v4.1.1

# Highlights

## Bugs fixed and code improvements:

 - #1904 Fixed incorrect treatment of [-inf,inf] cut limits when corresponding direction 
    in the original file is described by projection axis. Resulting cut ranges were
    incorrectly reduced by half of original binning step in each direction.
 - #1848 `symmetrize_sqw` now can work with rotational symmetry operations.
    To achieve that, algorithm which calculates transformation ranges when 
    `sqw` transformation during `sqw` generation is provided was modified. In addition to that, 
    the algorithm to generate `sqw` objects when transformation is present 
    has to be modified too. This fixed bugs and improve the efficiency of this
    algorithm eliminating expensing unnecessary binning within intermediate boundaries.
    The resulting routine works faster and does not cuts-off unnecessary pixels.
