## Release Notes v4.1.1

# Highlights

## Bugs fixed and code improvements:

 - #1904 Fixed incorrect treatment of [-inf,inf] cut limits when corresponding direction 
    in the original file is described by projection axis. Resulting cut ranges were
    incorrectly reduced by half of original binning step in each direction.
