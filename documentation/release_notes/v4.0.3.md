## Release Notes v4.0.3

Highlights

## Bugs fixed and code improvements:

 - #1787,#1895 The graphics algorithms have been refactored to make them more robust, fixing a number of bugs,
   simplifying   the chain of nested calls to graphics management functions of the 'genie_figure' type, 
   making full consistency of sliceomatic across IX_dataset_*d, d*d and sqw. The structure remains very similar. Included are a comprehensive set of tests.

    Regarding documentation, an ADD has been created (12_Horace_graphics.md) that explains how the graphics
    management and uniform interface operates (the latter was briefly described already in 07-sqw_redesign,
    and the same inheritance diagram is repeated). In addition, a folder has been created /examples/ that contains a script example_plotting.m that demonstrates some very basic plotting (calling a function data_for_plotting.m in the same folder that returns some instances of IX_dataset_*d, d*d and sqw objects).

 - #1830 Fixed issue with reading Horace-3 sqw files, when data for experiments
   with beam aligned along [0,1,0] directions failed to be loaded in Horace-3.
