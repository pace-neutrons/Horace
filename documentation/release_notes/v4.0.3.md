## Release Notes v4.0.3

# Highlights

 - #1817 Horace have reach set of operations to work with sqw objects. Plus, minus, sqw_eval replicate, etc allow one 
   to calculate various mathematical models on the basis of sqw objects and analyse them extracting,
   adding and mixing models with each other and comparing them with the results obtained in experiment.
   
   Recently these operations have been extended to filebased sqw objects which enables user to work with filebased
   objects exactly like with the objects in memory. The only issue with such filebacked objects is that an operation
   over whole sqw objects takes say, about 5-10 minutes and if you do 3 operations (e.g. model background (sqw_eval),
   extract model from sqw object, (minus) and mask negative values (mask) it will take 30 minutes to do them all.
   
   This ticket partially solves this issue by allowing user to write custom operation, which would combine
   multiple operations performed over filebacked pixels into single operations, so perform multiple operations,
   which performance is defined by the speed of IO access, in one go achieving correspondent acceleration.

## Bugs fixed and code improvements:

 - #1152 fixed, adapted to multiple instruments and enabled algorithm, which allows
   pixels coordinates recalculations from pixel indices, stored in PixelData indices
   fields. This algorithm can be used for calculating resolution convolution on symmetrized
   files and as part of algorithms which compress pixel data for writing then on disk.

 - #1830 Fixed issue with reading Horace-3 sqw files, when data obtained from experiments
   with beam aligned along [0,1,0] directions failed to be loaded in Horace-4.
