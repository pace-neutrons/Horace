## Release Notes v4.0.3

Highlights

## Bugs fixed and code improvements:

 - #1152 fixed, adapted to multiple instruments and enabled algorithm, which allows
   pixels coordinates recalculations from pixel indices, stored in PixelData indices
   fields. This algorithm can be used for calculating resolution convolution on symmetrized
   files and as part of algorithms which compress pixel data for writing then on disk.

 - #1830 Fixed issue with reading Horace-3 sqw files, when data obtained from experiments
   with beam aligned along [0,1,0] directions failed to be loaded in Horace-4.
 
   The details of the fixed issues are available on
