## Release Notes v3.7

    Transitional release, getting ready for keeping a projection in the sqw object. May be not actually released.

## Critical changes
 - the object with all bins equal 1 is 0 dimensional object and not 4-D object
 - `gen_sqw` sets its u_to_rlu matrix to unity, instead of an instance of ub_matrix, used for conversion from
   the coordinate frame, related to beam to hkl space. The original UB matrix, as before is stored in header
   (experiment_info->experiment)
