## Release Notes v4.1.0

# Highlights

 - #1817 Horace have reach set of operations to work with sqw objects. `Plus`, `minus`, `sqw_eval`, `replicate`,
   etc allow one to calculate various mathematical models on the basis of `sqw `objects and analyse them extracting,
   adding and mixing models with each other and comparing them with the results obtained in experiment.
   
   Recently these operations have been extended to filebased `sqw` objects which enables user to work with filebased
   objects exactly like with the objects in memory. The only issue with such filebacked objects is that an operation
   over whole sqw objects takes say, about 5-10 minutes and if you do 3 operations (e.g. model background (sqw_eval),
   extract model from sqw object, (minus) and mask negative values (mask) it will take 30 minutes to do them all.
   
   This ticket partially solves this issue introducing `sqw_op` algorithm which allows user to write custom
   operation combining multiple operations performed over filebacked pixels into a single operation. 
   Algorithm would perform multiple operations, which performance is defined by the speed of IO access, in one go achieving correspondent acceleration.
   
 - #1854 In addition to `sqw_op` algorithm, which allows changing pixel's signal and error only, this ticket adds
   `sqw_op_bin_pixels` algorithm which allows user to write function changing any pixel data. The example
   of such function may be a function which extracts model background and moves all data recorded in a multiple
   Brillouin zones into a single one.
   
   By format, this algorithm accepts mixture of `sqw_op`&`sqw_eval` parameters (user function and its input parameters) and
   `cut` options  (projection, describing target coordinate system and binning parameters).
   
   Unlike `cut` algorithm which works with pixels selection defined by a projection, `sqw_op_bin_pixels` algorithm works over all pixels present in sqw object. This allows user to write simpler user function but is much slower in comparison with `cut` algorithm.

 - #1776,#1846 Added `instrument_view_cut` algorithm, which allows to make a cut in the spectrometer frame. 
   This cut ignores crystal orientation and can be used in diagnostics providing user with reach information
   about various issues related to spectrometer or problems with consistency of data stored in old `sqw` files.

## Bugs fixed and code improvements:

 - #1862 A method to extract Magnetic Form factor calculation functions from `MagneticIons` class
   is modified to make it more convenient for operating with new `sqw_op` & `sqw_op_bin_pixels` algorithms.

 - #1152 fixed, adapted to multiple instruments and enabled algorithm, which allows
   pixels coordinates recalculations from pixel indices, stored in PixelData indices
   fields. This algorithm can be used for calculating resolution convolution on symmetrized
   files and as part of algorithms which compress pixel data for writing then on disk.

 - #1830 Fixed issue with reading Horace-3 sqw files, when data obtained from experiments
   with beam aligned along [0,1,0] directions failed to be loaded in Horace-4.
