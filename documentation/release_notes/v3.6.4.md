# Release Notes v3.6.4

This is bugfix release related to specific issue identified during running Horace. 
You may be affected by this issue if you used Horace in ISIS in 2022-February:2023
and want to use Tobyfit or resolution convolution estimates.

To verify if you are affected, take 2D cut around elastic line and see it using run inspector,
e.g:

```MATLAB
	test_cut = cut(my_sqw_file,0.1,0.1,[-0.1,0.1],[-10,10]);
	run_inspector(test_cut)
```

If run_inspector shows only single run contributed to image, your `sqw` file was generated incorrectly. If 
you can see that inspector shows multiple images changing with changed run_id, your `sqw` file was generated 
correctly.

If you want to use Tobyfit or estimate resolution convolution and have incorrectly generated sqw file,
download this release and regenerate your sqw files. 
Alternatively use ISIS IDAAaS service to process your data.
