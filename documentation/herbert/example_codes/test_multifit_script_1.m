% Example test script to show how to create multi-dimensional Gaussians
% for testing parallel multifit.
%
% The examples are for 1D, 2D and 3D. The demonstrate the use of the
% slow_func function to massively increase
% the function evaluation time of the Gaussian (or any other function of
% the particular dimensionality) in order to increase the CPU load.
%
% Use these to construct test fits for a selection of different arrays of
% different sizes to benchmark parallel multifit.

% One-dimensional example

w = IX_dataset_1d (x1);

const = 10; df_by_dx1 = 0;
pb = [const, df_by_dx1];            % parameters for linear background

% Create dataset with 1d Gaussian on planar background as data
w = func_eval(w, @gauss, pf);           % 'foreground' model
w = w + func_eval(w, @linear_bg, pb);   % add 'background' model
win = noisify (w, 'poisson');           % noisify with poisson noise

% Multifit with slow function evaluation. The result of a fit should
% be parameters that are the same as the ones for which the simulation
% was created
nslow = 10000;  % each function evaluation of the 2D Gaussian will take
                % the same time as ~250,000 exponentiations
