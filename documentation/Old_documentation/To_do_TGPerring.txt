Tobyfit NEW  (22/5/19)
-----------------
*MUST* merge IX_data_1d and IX_datset_1d - the problem is (1) it is simply the wrong way to do things,
and (2) you cannot access help in the usual way e.g. >> help IX_datset_1d/shift

IX_dataset_1d as a method of IX_Dataset_2d disappeared (and possibly other permutations)

multifit:
- Alex changs of may 2019 - jul 2019 (set_fun_private_, sontraints_remove, fun_alter)
- SOme hcanges that RAE made for crystal refinement options
- Overhaul multifit commands as Alex discussion he wants (Jul 2019)

That problem with LET resfun plotting if q=[0.3,1.20]

For backwards compatibility:
	- If set_instrument given a structure (or array of structures), attempt to construct an instrument (will be LET or MAPS)
	- Instrument components should attempt to construct the corresponding new format object


File operation for use with changing instrument properties
The low level reading/writing routines need to be changed in addition
	get_mod_pulse_horace 				***DONE*** (as all the work is done in sqw/get_mod_pulse, now changed)
	set_mod_pulse_horace 				***DONE*** (as all the work is done in sqw/set_mod_pulse, now changed)
	get_efix_horace								***DONE*** (as all the work is done in sqw/get_efix, which needs no change)
	set_efix_horace								***DONE*** (as all the work is done in sqw/set_efix, which needs no change)
  [get_instrument_horace                does not exist; not needed]
	set_instrument_horace 				need to edit to check input is IX_inst (also calls set_instr_or_sample_horace_)
	set_inst_or_sample_horace_ 		might not need any changes
	
	get_mod_pulse 		*** DONE ***
	set_mod_pulse		*** DONE ***
	get_efix 					- do not need to touch (not affected by instrument class changes)
	set_efix 					- do not need to touch (same reason)
  [get_instrument   		- does not exist; not needed]
	set_instrument 		*** DONE ***


	
Make IX_inst an abstract class, so that we can force the requirement of moderator as a set-able and get-able public property 

mc_contributions to be passed to tobyfit_DG*_resfun_covariance

set ei for moderator in instrument files (and all choppers)

Sort out the array sizes using size_array_stack and size_array_split (allover the place, rand, covariance etc)
and replace squeeze(reshape... 

General clear out of redundant functions - check if any more to do

indicies => indices everywhere (hundred of files)

=================================================================================
@sqw/private/proj_fill_fields  not used
@projection/private/proj_fill_fields not used

@projaxes/projaxes_to_rlu     and    @projection/private/rlu_to_ustep_matrix almost the same



Update documentation - multi cut for sqw; case of no proj for sqw

write dimsplit

Handling of errors in cut_sqw_main_single; mustn't crash cut_sqw_main

move output sqw file open check; write for multi output

refine timing output if necessary


=================================================================================
Detpar, proj should be classes in their own right in sqw objects

dnd should have 4 components of Q

pix array should hold unsymmetrised q coordinates

Need a flag to say if symmetrised

Need a flag to say if energy shifted or not

'ave' option is problematic if have symmetrised cut

symmetrisation work for non-orthogonal lattices

instrument needs to be a class
