# Build/Release pipeline

Build and test pipelines have been created in ANVIL for the Horace and Herbert
source.

All users should be using a build that has been built, tested and packaged
using the build pipelines.

## Master

The `master` branch should always be 'releasable' with all tests passing.
Builds are run on all target platforms to create `.zip`/`.tar.gz` release
packages each night.

- The Herbert `master` branch is built and a zip release build artifact with
MATLAB-release and platform-specific binary is created.

- The Horace `master` branch is built and a zip release build artifact with
MATLAB-release and platform-specific binary is created, which includes the last
successful Herbert `master` build.

The Horace build artifact is a single deployable unit to a specific MATLAB/OS
platform.
This is equivalent to the artifact created by the legacy MATLAB create release
process.

## Features

Feature development and bug fixes should be performed on branches and reviewed
using a GitHub Pull Request (PR).

When a pull request is opened or updated the merged code of the PR branch and
`master` is built and tested.

1. Feature developed on a branch taken from the `master`
2. All tests likely to be affected by changes in Herbert and Horace must be run
 on developers machine
3. Create Herbert PR (if required) for merge into `master` branch
4. Create Horace PR (if required) - if a Herbert PR has been created too the
Horace PR must not be merged until the Herbert PR has been merged
5. If the build/test of the PR against the Release branch succeeds on all
platforms, and the code has been reviewed, the PR can be merged.

## Releases

The Jenkins build artifacts are are not accessible outside of STFC.
End users will be directed to GitHub to access packaged releases.

Release pipelines have been created on ANVIL,
these are to be used to create release candidates.

Deploy pipelines have also been created to push release candidates to GitHub.

This will:

- tag the Git revision with the release number (`vm.n.o`)
- copy the built artifact to the corresponding GitHub release

The release tag will be an anchor for any subsequently needed release branch
and patch branches.

The version number is stored in a text file (`VERSION`) in the root of the
Herbert and Horace source.
This will follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/)
and is used in the build process to set the version number in the MATLAB
and compiled C++ components.

## Deployment on ISIS computational services machines

To provide rapid response to user requests,
bug-fixes and all advantages of constant deployment process,
the release code is rapidly available to users who use ISIS computational
resources to process the results of their experiments.
The services providing these resources are currently iDaaaS
and ISISCOMPUTE services.
These services provide users with pool of virtual (iDaaaS) or real
(ISISCOMPUTE) Linux machines, connected to the common parallel file system.

By agreement, each machine of the pool has folder `/usr/locam/mprogs/`
containing number of symbolic links to  `Horace`, `Herbert`, `Horace_bugfix`
and `Herbert_bugfix` clones of the github repositories of the appropriate
packages.
In addition to that, it contains also reference  `/usr/local/mprogs/User`
pointing to the folder containing Horace,
Herbert and parallel MPI workers initialization scripts.
*Startup.m* script auto-generated on all service machines intended for the
users of inelastic experiments, enables Herbert/Horace code when Matlab starts.

The details of the packages installation and deployment on the ISIS machines
are provided in [ISIS Release Process documentation](11_ISIS_release.md)

As soon as release branch is tagged and created in the repository according to
the release  process,
the code, exposed through the links above is checked out and switched to the
recently released, so users can user the released version of the code.

## Patch releases

The experience shows that the main reasons for the bugs,
identified by users is small changes in user configuration,
specific for a user, and correct but #unexpected users operations with the code.
This is why, the bugfix process in ISIS normally starts from user sharing
screen with the member of the support team and the demonstration of the issue
to a member of the support team.

As soon as the issue is confirmed and is obvious that the bug fixing needs
changes in code base,
the member of the support team should switch user to the code tree,
where the changes would not affect other users.
The symbolic links to `Horace_bugfix` and `Herbert_bugfix` pointing to separate
clones of git repository are provided for this purpose.
At release, they are pointing to the same location as regular Horace/Herbert
branches.

To switch user to these branches, one issues
`herbert_on(/usr/local/mprogs/Herbert_bugfix/herbert_core)` and
`horace_on(/usr/local/mprogs/Horace_bugfix/horace_core)` commands.

If parallel execution is necessary for bug-fixing,
the supporter also needs to do similar changes in worker_4tests script
available in the **User** folder above.
`herbert_on/horace_on` commands within this script should be modifued to point
to the bugfix version of the code. The user's **parallel_config** class
`worker` field should then be assigned with `worker_4tests` value.
The default value of this field is `worker_v2` which initializes default
Horace/Herbert code base.
The `worker_v2` script will continue to be used by other users for their data
processing, until bug-fixing is completed and merged into the code base.

Patch releases will be made to release branches to resolve specific bugs
identified.
These should be tested and built through the same build pipeline as the initial
production releases.

<img src="./images/10_git_hotfix_branches.png">

1. User reports issue
2. Bug report issue created in GitHub/Issues documenting how to reproduce,
and include any custom scripts or data that triggered the issue
3. Fix developed on a branch (`xxx_branch`) taken from the *release* tag
(`Rm_n_o`)
4. All tests likely to be affected by changes in Herbert and Horace must be run
 on developers machine
5. PR created for merge into Release branch (`rel_m_n`) *and* `master` branch.
If this is the first release patch, the branch will need to be created
6. If the build and test of the PR to the Release branch succeeds on all
platforms, that build artifact can be released to the target platform as
version `m.n.o+1`

If the hot-fix is being done out-of-hours the PR can be merged by the developer
WITHOUT review provided all tests pass,
but the branch should not be deleted and should be reviewed at the earliest
opportunity.

On any Horace release branch, the associated version of Herbert (`Rm_n_x`) will
remain unchanged except for patches.

The same caveats apply about the Horace build dependencies on Herbert.

Advantages:

- build tools are not required on the production hardware
- all builds are created using the same build tools
- users are using a known, traceable, validated release

Disadvantages:

- slower; have to wait for full build and test pipeline to execute

## Hot-fix Releases

If a particular fix is required quickly on a target system, the full build and
test process can be bypassed so that facility users do not lose critical
machine time.

Quick modifications to the software, with only partial testing,
carry the risks of breaking other parts of the software,
so this is an exceptional use-case.
Non-time critical issues should be resolved through the standard Patch Release
process.

"Hot-fix" pipelines will be created in ANVIL
([Horace #241](https://github.com/pace-neutrons/Horace/issues/241) that only
build and package Herbert and Horace and do not run the tests.

This will complete is around 5 minutes as it is the test execution step of the
standard PR pipeline that take in excess of an hour to run.

1. User reports issue
2. Bug report issue created in GitHub/Issues documenting how to reproduce,
and include any custom scripts or data that triggered the issue
3. Fix developed on a branch (`xxx_branch`) taken from the *release* tag
(`Rm_n_o`)
4. New tests demonstrating the issue and its resolution are developed.
Tests identified as being likely to be affected by the code changes run on
developer's machine
5. Run the branch through the "hot-fix" build pipeline on Jenkins that *just*
executes the build and package steps
6. The build artifact can be released to the specific target platform as
version `m.n.o.<sha>`
7. Open PR to merge the hot-fix branch into the `master` and `rel_m_n` branches,
as per the standard Patch Release process
8. When the build and test of the PR to the Release branch succeeds on all
platforms, that build artifact can be released to all platforms as version
`m.n.o+1`

Advantages:

- users will run a tested and built version of Horace on all platforms most of
the time
- changes fixing an issue can be made rapidly so users will lose a minimum
amount of time while running experiments
- hot-fixed releases will have a version number including the the commit-SHA,
so the build will be identifiable and traceable
- no requirement to maintain a separate production branch.
The only "maintained" branches are the release branches and master
- patches will be rapidly deployed and well-defined, reproducible build
- packaged hot-fix release will be identical to a standard release so can be
deployed using the same processes

Disadvantages:

- not fully tested code released to part of the production system,
alleviated by the fact that affected user experienced issue anyway.
