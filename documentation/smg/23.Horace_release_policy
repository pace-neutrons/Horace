# Horace release policy

Recent additions to documentation have covered *how* to release Horace. This document covers *when* and *through* what 
channels Horace should be released. It follows initial discussions with David Voneshen of Excitations and is provisional
at the date of writing (28/10/2025) as this will be discussed further at the next Excitations meeting.
