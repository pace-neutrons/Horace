# Horace release policy

Recent additions to documentation have covered *how* to release Horace. This document covers *when* and *through* what 
channels Horace should be released. It follows initial discussions with David Voneshen of Excitations and is provisional
at the date of writing (28/10/2025) as this will be discussed further at the next Excitations meeting.

The two types of releases to be considered are
- scheduled releases (major and minor)
- patch/bugfix releases

## Scheduled releases

### Constraints

The existing known constraints on releases are:

1. Releases should not cause the usable version on IDAaaS (now ADA) to have unexpected behaviour due to recent 
unpublicized changes on the master branch.
2. Releases should happen off-cycle so that work done on experiments always uses a consistent version

subject to the need to fix bugs which prevent experimental analysis.

### Criteria for release

Two criteria were identified

- release of a new set of features
- regular releases to update bugfixes which were not important enough to warrant a release in their own right.

In the context of regular releases, it was noted that Mantid has a regular release cycle. For us this could be 
quarterly or half-yearly.

These releases should be subject to the above constraints.

### Customer testing

At the moment, while the downloadable release on Github is only deployed when the user downloads it, releases on
ADA are immediately present to the user when they access it. It was thought that the release should first be available
on a beta branch. Excitations users are actioned to test new releases, and if this can be separated from scientific work
this will give a greater margin of safety.
