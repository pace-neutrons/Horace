% And unzip the contents of that file into the crystal_datafiles folder

% Put the folder where you want generated files from this script to go:

% You should see that there are 3 streaks all in the same direction,
% all coming out of a Bragg peak.
run_inspector(cut1_sp1)
% Move through the runs – you should see around run 22 that there is a very
% intense diagonal streak which is present in several runs.

% The excitations are too intense and are not symmetric about the Bragg peak
% so they are not real dispersion, but because they are associated with the
% sample Bragg peak, it suggests they _are_ scattering from the sample.
% In fact they are a detector artefact. This happens because the crystal
% is aligned such that equivalent off-plane Bragg peaks hit a single detector
% tube at the same time causing the electronics to misrecord neutron events,
% because the peaks are so intense.

%% The second dataset
w_sp2 = read_sqw([edatc_folder '/crystal_datafiles/spurious2.sqw'])
plot(w_sp2)

% You should see that there are Bragg peaks but they don’t seem to have the
% 6-fold symmetry you would expect from the (111) plane of a cubic crystal.
run_inspector(w_sp2, 'col', [0,10000])

% Move through the run_inspector. You should see that the sqw file was formed
% of a set of 46 scans from 0 to 90 deg in 2 deg steps, and then another
% 45 scans from 1 to 89 deg in 2 deg steps.
% Comparing runs 22-27 and 69-74 (you can use run_inspector twice to get 2 plots)
% you should see the scattering is similar but doesn't match up
% (e.g. run 22 looks like run 70 but are 5 degrees apart).
% This is because during the rotation from 90 deg to 1 deg for the second set
% of scans, the sample assembly became stuck and the motor lost its position
% So the second set was not actually measuring from 1 to 89 deg.
