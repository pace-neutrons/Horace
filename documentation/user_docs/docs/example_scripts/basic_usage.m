%                         Making cuts and slices
% =========================================================================

% Before making a cut, we have to define viewing (projection) axes, and
% these u and v do not need to be the same as the sample orientation which
% is defined by u and v above (where u||ki at psi=0).
% These u and v just define the Q axes for cut_sqw. Generally you only need
% to define the first two axes, u and v. The third axis w is implicitly
% constructed as being perpendicular to the plane defined by u and v.
% The units of the Q axes are specified by the 'type', which can be 'r'
% for r.l.u. or 'a' for absolute units (A^-1).
% E.g. 'rar' means u and w are in r.l.u, v in A^-1.
% The offset gives a offset for the zero of that axis, with the fourth
% coordinate being the energy transfer in meV.
% Type: >> doc line_proj   for more details.
% Note that the default for uoffset is [0,0,0,0] so it doesn't need to be set
proj = line_proj([-1,-1,1], [0,1,1], 'uoffset', [0,0,0,0], 'type', 'rrr');

% The syntax for cut is:
%
% cut = cut(sqw_file, proj, u_axis_limits, v_axis_limits, w_axis_limits, ...
%               en_axis_limits, keywords)
%
% The *_axis_limits are either:
%   1. a single number, [0.05], which means that this axis will be plotted
%      with the number being the bin size and limits being the limits of
%      the data.
%   2. two numbers, [-1, 1], which means that this axis will be integrated
%      over between the specified limits.
%   3. three numbers, [-1, 0.05, 1], which means that this axis will be
%      plotted between the first value to the last value with the bin size
%      specified by the middle value.

% In the following we make 3d volume plots along u, v and energy and
% integrating over the w direction. The '-nopix' at the end means that
% cut_sqw will discard all pixel information - that is it will only retain
% the counts and errors for each bin rather than keep the counts of each
% neutron event which is enclosed by each bin. This saves a lot of memory
% and is good enough for plotting but would not be good enough for fitting,
% or for re-cutting as shown below.
my_vol = cut(sqw_file, proj, [-3,0.05,3], [-3,0.05,3], [-0.1,0.1], [0,4,360], '-nopix');
plot(my_vol);

% Now we make 2D slices integrating over both v and w in Q.
my_slice = cut(sqw_file, proj, [-3,0.05,3], [-1.1,-0.9], [-0.1,0.1], [0,4,280]);
plot(my_slice);

% Now we make a 1D cut along u, timing how long it takes.
tic
my_cut = cut(sqw_file, proj, [-3,0.05,3], [-1.1,-0.9], [-0.1,0.1], [130,150]);
toc
plot(my_cut);

% In addition to cutting from an sqw file, you can also cut from a previous
% cut. Note that if the previous cut had used '-nopix', the cut bins must
% be aligned with the old cut. Thus if you want to re-cut a cut, do not
% use '-nopix'.
tic
my_cut2 = cut(my_slice, [], [130,150]);
% The [] above is to keep 1st axes as it is, [130,150] is integration range
% for 2nd axis note because the object we are cutting from is 2d, we only
% need 2 binning arguments, rather than the 4 that are needed when taking a
% cut form the 4-dimensional dataset in the file
toc

plot(my_cut2);
% This plot is identical to my_cut, but was much faster to create.
% Imagine if you were running a script to take many cuts from the data - it
% is probably quicker to take them from existing data objects, where
% possible!

% For use with later example scripts, save a cut and slice
save(my_slice, [output_data_folder '/iron_slice.sqw'])
save(my_cut, [output_data_folder '/iron_cut.sqw'])

% Make axes tight:

% Smoothing:
%plot(smooth(my_slice)); % this gives an error - think about why!

%

% to d2d / dnd object that is smaller in memory and without detector pixel info

% Smoothing options:
plot(smooth(d2d(my_slice),[2,2],'gaussian'));

% Set colour scale and other axes scales in script:
lz 0 0.5

% harder to tell the right reciprocal lattice coordinates by eye.
