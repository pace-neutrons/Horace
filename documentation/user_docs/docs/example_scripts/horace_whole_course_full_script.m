%                Accumulating data to an existing sqw file
% =========================================================================
%
% The above gen_sqw file generates an sqw file from the list of input
% spe or nxspe files in one go, and deletes all temporary files after it
% finishes. If you are in the middle of a rotation scan, you can use
% accumulate_sqw which does not delete the temporary files and so can
% append newly processed spe/nxspe files to an existing sqw file.
% This may save some time in processing, but is not now generally
% recommended since the implementation of parallelisation in gen_sqw has
% made gen_sqw much faster.
%
% This is because accumulate_sqw needs to know _all_ the psi values
% (including those not yet measured) in order to construct  coarse data
% grid that enables Horace to make fast cuts. If you then include
% measurements at psi values not in the original list, then it is possible
% that some data will lie outside this grid and it will be 'lost' to the
% sqw file. If the additional runs are ones that interleave between the
% original files, this will not be a problem, but if the additional runs
% extend the original angular range, then you must use the 'clean' option
% which is equivalent to gen_sqw.
%
% The syntax for accumulate_sqw is very similar to gen_sqw:
%
% accumulate_sqw(spefile, par_file, sqw_file, efix, emode, alatt, angdeg,...
%                u, v, psi, omega, dpsi, gl, gs)
%
% Or:
% accumulate_sqw(spefile, par_file, sqw_file, efix, emode, alatt, angdeg,...
%                u, v, psi, omega, dpsi, gl, gs, 'clean')
%
% This is a way of appending newly processed spe files to an existing
% dataset. The key point is that the psi and spe_file arrays contain a list
% of PLANNED files and run-numbers - only those that actually exist will be
% included in the file.
%
% You can run this periodically, for example overnight.


%% ========================================================================
%                         Making cuts and slices
% =========================================================================

% Before making a cut, we have to define viewing (projection) axes, and
% these u and v do not need to be the same as the sample orientation which
% is defined by u and v above (where u||ki at psi=0).
% These u and v just define the Q axes for cut_sqw. Generally you only need
% to define the first two axes, u and v. The third axis w is implicitly
% constructed as being perpendicular to the plane defined by u and v.
% The units of the Q axes are specified by the 'type', which can be 'r'
% for r.l.u. or 'a' for absolute units (A^-1).
% E.g. 'rar' means u and w are in r.l.u, v in A^-1.
% The offset gives a offset for the zero of that axis, with the fourth
% coordinate being the energy transfer in meV.
% Type: >> doc line_proj   for more details.
% Note that the default for offset is [0,0,0,0] so it doesn't need to be set
proj = line_proj([-1,-1,1], [0,1,1], 'offset', [0,0,0,0], 'type', 'rrr');

% The syntax for cut_sqw is:
%
% cut = cut_sqw(sqw_file, proj, u_axis_limits, v_axis_limits, w_axis_limits, ...
%               en_axis_limits, keywords)
%
% The *_axis_limits are either:
%   1. a single number, [0.05], which means that this axis will be plotted
%      with the number being the bin size and limits being the limits of
%      the data.
%   2. two numbers, [-1, 1], which means that this axis will be integrated
%      over between the specified limits.
%   3. three numbers, [-1, 0.05, 1], which means that this axis will be
%      plotted between the first value to the last value with the bin size
%      specified by the middle value.

% In the following we make 3d volume plots along u, v and energy and
% integrating over the w direction. The '-nopix' at the end means that
% cut_sqw will discard all pixel information - that is it will only retain
% the counts and errors for each bin rather than keep the counts of each
% neutron event which is enclosed by each bin. This saves a lot of memory
% and is good enough for plotting but would not be good enough for fitting,
% or for re-cutting as shown below.
my_vol = cut(sqw_file, proj, [-3,0.05,3], [-3,0.05,3], [-0.1,0.1], [0,4,360], '-nopix');
plot(my_vol);

% Now we make 2D slices integrating over both v and w in Q.
my_slice = cut(sqw_file, proj, [-3,0.05,3], [-1.1,-0.9], [-0.1,0.1], [0,4,280]);
plot(my_slice);

% Now we make a 1D cut along u, timing how long it takes.

my_cut = cut(sqw_file, proj, [-3,0.05,3], [-1.1,-0.9], [-0.1,0.1], [130,150]);
toc

% In addition to cutting from an sqw file, you can also cut from a previous
% cut. Note that if the previous cut had used '-nopix', the cut bins must
% be aligned with the old cut. Thus if you want to re-cut a cut, do not
% use '-nopix'.
tic
my_cut2 = cut(my_slice, [], [130,150]);
% The [] above is to keep 1st axes as it is, [130,150] is integration range
% for 2nd axis note because the object we are cutting from is 2d, we only
% need 2 binning arguments, rather than the 4 that are needed when taking a

% The excitations are too intense and are not symmetric about the Bragg peak

% In fact they are a detector artefact. This happens because the crystal

% tube at the same time causing the electronics to misrecord neutron events,
% because the peaks are so intense.

% Comparing runs 22-27 and 69-74 (you can use run_inspector twice to get 2 plots)
% you should see the scattering is similar but doesn't match up
% (e.g. run 22 looks like run 70 but are 5 degrees apart).
