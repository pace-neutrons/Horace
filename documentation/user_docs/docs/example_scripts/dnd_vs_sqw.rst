dnd vs sqw: the difference
##########################

This tutorial was originally a script designed to illustrate and explain the
different key data types -- ``sqw`` and ``dnd`` (the ``d0d``, ``d1d`, ...
family). -- in Horace, and why they are important.

`Whole script`_ available here.

The key difference is that ``sqw`` objects contain the exact data for each
measurement (pixels) while ``dnd`` objects simply contain the histogrammed
(binned) accumulation of these data.

For more information on the differences between ``dnd`` and ``sqw``, :ref:`see
here <manual/FAQ:What is the difference between sqw and dnd objects>`.

.. code-block:: matlab

   %Take two cuts:
   sqw_file='/mnt/data/Science/URu2Si2/data/sqw/Ei81_20K.sqw';

   proj = line_proj([1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0]);

   csqw=cut(sqw_file, proj, [-0.5, 0.5], [-4, 0.04, -2], [-0.05, 0.05], [0, 0.8, 60]);

   %identical to above, except extra argument at the end
   cdnd=cut(sqw_file, proj, [-0.5, 0.5], [-4, 0.04, -2], [-0.05, 0.05], [0, 0.8, 60], '-nopix');

The plots look (are!) identical. So what's the difference? Double click on them
in the Workspace part of the Matlab window. You can see that the ``csqw`` object
has a lot more information associated with it.

General principle
=================

Use ``dnd`` if you are just looking at the data - it takes up less computer
memory, which is a good thing.

If you want to ``fit`` or ``simulate`` the data and you are only simulating a
basic function (i.e. using ``func_eval``, ``multifit_func``, etc) that does not
depend on all 4 coordinates of Q and E, then use a ``dnd``.

Example:

.. code-block:: matlab

   cgaussdnd=func_eval(cdnd, @gauss2d, [1, -3, 30, 0.2, 0.1, 100]);
   plot(cgaussdnd);
   keep_figure;

   cgausssqw=func_eval(csqw, @gauss2d, [1, -3, 30, 0.2, 0.1, 100]);
   plot(cgausssqw);
   keep_figure;


.. figure:: ../images/dnd_vs_sqw_fig3.jpg
   :align: center
   :width: 500

.. figure:: ../images/dnd_vs_sqw_fig4.jpg
   :align: center
   :width: 500


The two figures are identical, because the func_eval routine only uses the plot
axis coordinates as its input, not (H, K, L, E).

If you want to ``fit`` or ``simulate`` data with an S(Q, E) model, you should
use ``sqw``. This is because you will account for the fact that you had to
integrate along the non-plot axes correctly. The following example illustrates
why this is important:

.. code-block:: matlab

   %model of ferromagnetic spin waves in the Horace demo
   csimsqw=sqw_eval(csqw, @demo_FM_spinwaves_2dSlice_sqw, [4, 2, 1, 1, 1]);
   csimdnd=sqw_eval(cdnd, @demo_FM_spinwaves_2dSlice_sqw, [4, 2, 1, 1, 1]);

   %Dispersion has equal steepness along all reciprocal space directions.
   plot(csimsqw);
   keep_figure;

   plot(csimdnd);
   keep_figure;

.. figure:: ../images/dnd_vs_sqw_fig5.jpg
   :align: center
   :width: 500

.. figure:: ../images/dnd_vs_sqw_fig6.jpg
   :align: center
   :width: 500

These are totally different.

Why?

Because the simulation of the ``sqw`` object includes the dispersion along the
H-axis, and calculates what it is for the pixels actually measured. The
simulation of the ``dnd`` object assumes that every point has the average value
of H (zero in this case). So the latter gives a sharp dispersion, whereas the
former is very broad.

So if you have data from a system where there is some variation in the signal
along a non-plot axis, you should use ``simulate`` with ``sqw`` objects in order
to capture this correctly.

Specific case A: resolution modelling
=====================================

If you want to include resolution in your simulation or fitting, you must use
Tobyfit, and you also need the detector pixel information that you get in an
``sqw`` object but not in a ``dnd``.

.. warning::

   Tobyfit will give an error message if you try to use it with a ``dnd``.

Specific case B: spurion identification
=======================================

See separate tutorial about how to do this. Basically, if you need to know
something about data from a particular run, or from a particular detector, you
need ``sqw``.

Specific case C: smoothing
==========================

If you apply the ``smooth`` algorithm to your data you will get a dataset of the
same type back again.  Smoothing works for ``dnd``, but is forbidden for ``sqw``
data. The reason is that the smoothing operation only makes sense in the plot
axis coordinate frame. But doing that means you lose the connection between the
signal displayed in the plot and the detector pixel information that contributed
to it.

Specific case D: symmetrisation
===============================

.. warning::

   Currently in Horace 4.0.0, ``dnd`` symmetrisation is disabled. Due to
   extended transforms in the ``sqw`` object.

Symmetrisation does different things for ``sqw`` and ``dnd`` data. The latter
can be folded along an axis parallel to a plot axis. The former can be folded
along any axis. Generally you are much safer doing symmetrisation with ``sqw``
objects.
