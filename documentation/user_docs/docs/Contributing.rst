Contributing documentation
==========================

If you wish to contribute directly to the documentation, please follow the 5 step process below:

1. If you notice a mistake or a place which could be improved, click the "Click here to edit" button at the bottom of
   the page. This will take you to the GitHub edit page (requires `GitHub account <https://github.com/login>`__).
2. Correct the mistake in the GitHub editor (see `reST documentation
   <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html>`__).
3. Select the "Create a new branch for this commit" option at the bottom of the page, with comments describing your
   changes as appropriate in the "Add an optional extended description" box above and click "Propose changes" button.
4. In the ``labels`` tab on the right-hand panel select ``documentation`` and ``DO_NOT_CI`` labels. This makes it
   possible for the development team to track the changes more easily.
5. Click "Create pull request". This will submit the changes to the development team for review.

Following the acceptance of your suggestions, these changes will not appear in the main documentation until the next
full release, however it is possible to see the latest (subject to change) version of the documentation in the `unstable
documentation <https://pace-neutrons.github.io/Horace/unstable/>`__.
