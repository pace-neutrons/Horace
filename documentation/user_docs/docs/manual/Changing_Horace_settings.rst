Changing Horace settings
########################

The Horace tools use a number of configuration files to manage global
settings. This document seeks to outline the various settings contained in these
configurations.

To change one of the settings, type, for example;

::

   set(hor_config, 'mem_chunk_size', 500000);

or

::

   hc = hor_config;
   hc.mem_chunk_size = 500000;


All configurations have the following settings:

::

   class_name: 'parallel_config'
   saveable: 1
   returns_defaults: 0
   config_folder: '/home/jacob/.matlab/mprogs_config'

- ``class_name``: is the name of the current configuration.
- ``saveable``: Sets whether any changes to the config will be written to file
  and restored on next Matlab session.
- ``returns_defaults``: Ignore any user changes and return default
  configurations and settings.
- ``config_folder``: Folder where configurations are stored for reloading for
  new Matlab sessions.

Horace Config
=============

The Horace config (``hor_config``) manages configuration features of the Horace
library functions, such as how functions handle ``NaN`` and ``inf``, the
verbosity of the code and whether to use compiled C++ accelerator codes. It also
contains references to the ``hpc_config`` to manage high-performance
functionality.

  memory at a time during cuts.

  - -1 : No output is produced.

  - 0 : Major notifications are printed.

  - 1 : Minor notifications are printed.

  - 2 : Runs are timed and this information is printed too.

HPC Config
==========

The HPC config contains information relating to using high-performance (MEX and
parallel) code. It also contains references to several higher level features of
the ``parallel_config`` as well as a direct reference to the config itself.

- ``build_sqw_in_parallel`` : Whether to use parallel algorithms to generate and
  combine SQW objects
- ``combine_sqw_using`` : Determines the algorithm to use for SQW combination

  - ``matlab`` : this mode uses Matlab code to combine files. Slowest but most
    reliable method.

  - ``mex_code`` : Uses multi-threaded compiled C++ MEX code to combine
    files. MEX code needs to be compiled to use.

  - ``mpi_code`` : (Experimental) Uses the MPI Framework to combine files. Needs
    ``parallel_config`` set up

- ``combine_sqw_options`` : List of the possible options above
- ``mex_combine_thread_mode`` : Threading mode for when
  ``build_sqw_in_parallel`` is enabled.

  - 0 : one thread reads tmp files and another writes combined information into
    the target file

  - 1 : one thread writes combined sqw file and two threads are launched for
    each contributing file to read necessary information.

- ``mex_combine_buffer_size``: size of buffer in bytes used by MEX code while
  combining files per each file.
- ``parallel_multifit``: Enable fitting computation in parallel using the MPI
  Framework. Needs ``parallel_config`` set up.
- ``hpc_options`` : List of these options for use in internal functions.

Mirrors of ``parallel_config`` variables for access, see ``parallel_config`` for
more info.

Parallel Config

The ``parallel_config`` contains information relating to how the parallel
cluster is set up along with threading.

- ``worker``: (Advanced) Parallel worker script to run on instantiating parallel
  jobs.
- ``is_compiled``: (Advanced) Whether the above script is a compiled script or a
  raw matlab script.
- ``parallel_cluster``: Method of parallelism to employ options are:

  - ``herbert`` : Poor man's MPI cluster, single node only. Launches separate
    Matlab sessions using Java Launcher.  The sessions exchange information
    between each other using file-based messages (.mat files), so this cluster
    is not suitable for any tasks, demanding heavy interprocess communications.

  - ``parpool`` : Uses Matlab parallel computing toolbox to run parallel jobs.
    Refer to the parallel toolbox user's manual for the description of such
    clusters.

  - ``mpiexec_mpi`` : Uses C++ wrapped MPI libraries and mpiexec to run parallel
    jobs. MEX code needs to be compiled to use.

  - ``slurm_mpi`` : Uses C++ wrapped MPI libraries and submits job to Slurm job
    queues. MEX code needs to be compiled to use.

- ``cluster_config`` : The configuration class describing parallel cluster,
  defined for each cluster (see :ref:`manual/Parallel:Running Horace in
  Parallel`).
- ``parallel_workers_number`` : Number of parallel jobs to spawn for workers.
- ``is_auto_par_threads`` : Used in internal functions to determine whether
  ``par_threads`` has been manually set.
- ``threads`` : Number of threads to run C++ threaded jobs with.
- ``par_threads`` : Number of threads to run spawned parallel jobs with.
- ``known_clusters`` : List of available options for ``parallel_cluster``
- ``known_clust_configs`` : List of available options for ``cluster_config``
- ``shared_folder_on_local`` : Folder for file-based messaging for local machine
- ``shared_folder_on_remote`` : Folder for file-based messaging for remote
  machine (if different)
- ``working_directory`` : Folder where temporary files are written
- ``wkdir_is_default`` : Whether or not the ``working_directory`` has been
  manually assigned
- ``external_mpiexec`` : Path to ``mpiexec`` or ``mpirun`` program if not
  default (internal)
- ``slurm_commands`` : Extra command line arguments to be added to Slurm
  submission jobs (if ``parallel_cluster `` is ``slurm_mpi``)
- ``n_cores`` : Quick readout of Matlab's estimate of number of cores on local
  machine.
