Binary operations

Overview
========

Binary operations between two objects can be applied in a variety of ways in
Horace. You can either use the symbolic form (``+``, ``-`` , ``*``, ``/``,
``\``), or you can use the explicit function names (``plus, minus, mtimes,
mrdivide``, ``mldivide``).

Most Horace data objects have binary operations defined between them,
and you can perform operations between objects of different classes,
as long as the dimensions of the "image" contained in the objects agree
and/or the size of "pixels" array are the same.
As described in the :ref:`FAQ <manual/FAQ:What is the difference between sqw and dnd objects>`,
Horace data objects may contain up to two parts: an "image"
(histogrammed counts on a grid defined by the projection axes) and a set of "pixels"
(the raw counts from the data per detector element and energy bin).
The ``sqw`` class has both sets of information, whereas ``d1d``, ``d2d``, ``d3d``, ``d4d``,
``IX_dataset`` and ``sigvar`` objects contain only the "image" information,
and ``PixelData`` objects contain only pixel information.

Thus, you can perform a binary operation between an ``sqw`` object and any other Horace
object (as long as the "image" dimensions and the number of "pixels" agree) because it
contains both "image" and "pixel" data.
However, you cannot perform a binary operation between a ``d1d`` and a ``PixelData`` object
because one only has "image" data and the other only has "pixel" data.

You can perform a binary operation between a scalar number and any Horace data object.

You can perform a binary operation between a numeric Matlab array and any Horace data object
which contains an "image" as long as the array dimension and image dimension matches.

The result of the binary operation has the same type as the more "complex" of the input objects,
where "complexity" equates to the amount of information an object carries.
That is, an ``sqw`` object, which has both "image" and "pixel" data, is considered the most complex,
whereas a ``sigvar`` object which just has count data (a signal and a variance array) but no
coordinate information is considered the least complex.

Thus, an operation between a ``sqw`` and a ``d3d`` object will yield a ``sqw`` output.
Such an operation will not only produce a different "image", it will also change the "pixels"
in order to maintain consistency between the two parts of the ``sqw`` output object.
For example, if you perform the operation:

.. code-block:: matlab

   w_sub = w_sqw - w_d2d_bkg

where ``w_sqw`` is a ``sqw`` object and ``w_d2d_bkg`` is a ``d2d``, then ``w_sub`` will be a ``sqw``
and the signal value of each "pixel" in ``w_sub`` which contributes to a particular bin (histogram)
in the "image" of ``w_sqw`` will be reduced by the value of the corresponding bin in ``w_d2d_bkg``
divided by the number of "pixels" contributing to that bin.

Commonly used binary operations are described in more detail below.


sqw objects
===========

Let us take for our example the addition operator ``+``. Our initial ``sqw``
object is called ``w2`` and has an attached ``pix`` array.

.. note::

   In the case of ``sqw`` objects, binary operations transform the ``signal``
   and ``variance`` elements of the pixel data.
..
   .. note::

      You can have an ``sqw`` object without the pix array by converting a
      ``dnd`` to ``sqw``, though this is inadvisable as a lot of important information
	  about experiment specific to ``sqw`` object remains empty as the result of this
	  operation.

Single sqw object
-----------------

You operate on ``w2`` with the following types:

- ``w2_sqw`` is an ``sqw`` object with a pix array of identical size to the pix
  array of ``w2``.

  ::

     wout = w2 - w2_sqw;

.. note::

   A common use for this is when a background dataset has been created that maps
   exactly onto the real dataset, and needs to be subtracted.

- ``w2_dnd`` is a ``dnd`` object commensurate with ``w2.data``

  ::

     wout = w2 + w2_dnd;


- ``num`` is a numeric array of the same size as the ``w2.pix.signal`` array of ``w2``.

  ::

     wout = w2 + num;

- ``scalar`` is a single number to apply to all of the data in ``w2``.

  ::

     wout = w2 + scalar;

..
   - ``w2_sqw_dnd_type`` is an sqw of dnd type (i.e. no it has pix array) whose
     plot axes overlap exactly with those of ``w1``. An example is taking a 1d
     cut along the energy axis from two different regions of reciprocal space,
     and then adding or subtracting one from the other. In this case the output
     will be a sqw object of dnd type, since the pixel information has lost its
     connection with the signal and error that are plottable.

     :: wout = w2 + w2_sqw_dnd_type;

.. note:

Array of sqw objects
--------------------

You can use the same binary operation syntax as for single sqw objects, with the
following conditions

- ``w2_sqw`` is either a scalar ``sqw`` object of commensurate size to all of
  the sqw objects in the array, or an array of ``sqw`` objects with each object
  of commensurate size to its corresponding element of ``w2``.

..
   - ``w2_sqw_dnd`` is as above, i.e. an array of dnd-type sqw objects whose
   plot axes match element by element those of the array ``w2``.

- ``w2_dnd`` same rules as for sqw of dnd type above.

- ``num`` is a numeric array following the size rules above.

- ``scalar`` the same scalar is subtracted from every pix array in the array of
  sqw objects.

dnd objects
===========

Let us again take for our example the addition operator ``+``, with our initial
``dnd`` object called ``w2`` .

.. note::

   In the case of ``dnd`` objects, binary operations transform the ``s`` and
   ``e`` matrices


Single dnd object
-----------------

You can add values to ``w2`` in the following ways:

- ``w2_sqw`` is an ``sqw`` object with a ``dnd`` (in ``data``) of identical size to
  ``w2``.

  ::

     wout = w2 + w2_sqw;

- ``w2_dnd`` is a ``dnd`` object commensurate with ``w2``.

  ::

     wout = w2 + w2_dnd;


- ``num`` is a numeric array of the same size as the arrays of ``w1``.

  ::

     wout = w2 + num;

- ``scalar`` is a single number to apply to all of the data in ``w2``.

  ::

     wout = w2 + scalar;


Array of dnd objects
--------------------

Similar to arrays of sqw objects.

As for sqw objects, arrays have to be the same size as the array of dnd objects
with respectively commensurate array sizes, or a scalar object as the same size
of each.



Tips and Tricks
===============

List of operations and their equivalent code
--------------------------------------------

The arithmetic operations above correspond to equivalent MATLAB functions. For reference,
the corresponding functions are:

::

   w1 + w2 --> plus(w1,w2);
   w1 - w2 --> minus(w1,w2);
   w1 * w2 --> mtimes(w1,w2);
   w1 / w2 --> mrdivide(w1,w2);
   w1 \ w2 --> mldivide(w1,w2);
   w1 ^ w2 --> mpower(w1,w2);


.. warning::

   The matrix operations ``*``, ``/``, ``\`` and ``^`` (``mtimes``,
   ``mrdivide``, ``mldivide`` and ``mpower``) are performed
   element-by-element. So the equivalent MATLAB routines would be ``.*``,
   ``./``, ``.\`` and ``.^`` respectively.

..

.. warning::

	Binary operations between Horace objects, unlike arithmetic operations are not fully invertible.
	If you do ``w_out = w1+w2`` and ``w1_out = w_out-w2`` ``w1_out ~= w1``.
	
	Actually ``w1.data.s==w1_out.data.s`` and ``w1.pix.signal==w1_out.pix.signal`` but
	errors are accumulated in each operation so:
	
	``w1.data.e<w1_out.data.e`` and ``w1.pix.variance<w1_out.pix.variance``

Binary operations manager
--------------------------------------------

``sqw`` objects contain both pixels and image information and this information is consistent, i.e.
image is calculated from pixels and pixels are sorted within ``PixelData`` array in such a way that the block of
pixels contributed into image bin(cell) is located in specific position of ``PixelData`` array and this position can be
identified from image. The position ``i_1`` of the first pixel contributing into image bin(cell) number ``n`` is defined by
formula: ``i_1 = cumsum(sqw.data.npix(1:n-1))+1`` and the last by: ``i_{end} = i_1+sqw.data.npix(n)-1`` where
``sqw.data.npix`` refers to ``npix`` array of ``dnd`` object. Particular pixels positions between ``i_1`` and ``i_{end}``
are random.

When you perform binary operation between two objects containing pixels, the pixels have to be sorted within the bin to ensure
the operation is performed between correspondent pixels. In many cases, user may be sure that the operation is performed between two
objects with pixels ordered in the same way. For example, you calculate foreground and background on the same ``sqw`` object and now want
to add them together. In this case, you may decrease time of your ``plus`` operation by avoiding sorting pixels within the bins as follows:

.. code-block:: matlab

	my_cut = read_sqw(file_with_sqw);
	w_fg   = sqw_eval(my_cut,@my_foreground,foreground_parameters);
	w_bg   = sqw_eval(my_cut,@my_background,background_parameters);	
	w_sum  = binary_op_manager(w_fg,w_bg,@plus,true);
	
If the last parameter of ``binary_op_manager`` is set to ``true`` it disables sorting pixels in bins while performing binary operations.

.. warning::

	Use this option carefully. If you do binary operation between two objects with pixels sorted differently, the first result would look correct.
	Unfortunately, any future operations on the result of such operation may produce completely unexpected results.
