Unary operations
################

A unary operation is one that is performed on a single object, with no additional inputs. A single object is returned.

unary plus
==========

Unary plus. Returns the input object ``win`` with no modification.

::

   wout = +win


Equivalent to ``wout = uplus(win)``

unary minus
===========

Unary minus. Returns the intensity field of the input object multiplied by -1, i.e. ``wout = -1  win``.

::

   wout = -win


Equivalent to ``wout = uminus(win)``


Trigonometric and hyperbolic functions
======================================

With the form

::

   wout = function(win)


where ``function`` is any of the following, trigonometric or hyperbolic operations may be performed on dnd or sqw objects.

- acos - arc cosine
- acosh - arc cosh
- acot - arc cot
- acoth - arc coth
- acsc - arc cosec
- acsch - arc cosech
- asec - arc sec
- asech - arc sech
- asin - arc sine
- asinh - arc sinh
- atan - arc tangent
- atanh - arc tanh
- cos - cosine
- cosh - cosh
- cot - cot
- coth - coth
- csc - cosec
- csch - cosech
- sec - sec
- sech - sech
- sin - sine
- sinh - sinh
- tan - tangent
- tanh - tanh


Other mathematical functions
============================

Using the same syntax as above, one can perform the following operations:

- exp - exponential
- log - natural logarithm
- log10 - logarithm base 10
