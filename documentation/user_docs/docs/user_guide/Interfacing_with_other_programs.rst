###############################
Interfacing with other programs
###############################

Horace is designed to be able to call other programs to calculate models for simulating and fitting data.

This document describes two interfaces with other `PACE <https://www.isis.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/Proper-analysis-of-coherent-excitations.aspx>`__ projects:

- `Euphonic <https://euphonic.readthedocs.io/>`__

- `SpinW <https://spinw.org/>`__

as well as a generic way of interfacing with modelling codes you may want to use with Horace.

We also note that the `Brille library <https://brille.github.io>`__ for :math:`q`-space interpolation
is also a PACE project and is used internally by Euphonic and SpinW to speed up calculations.
Documentation for how to accomplish this may be found in the relevant Euphonic and SpinW documentation.

Recap on evaluating functions on a Horace workspace
---------------------------------------------------

As described in the :ref:`Simulation section <user_guide/Getting_started:Simulations>`,
Horace takes two types of model functions:

- User model functions which operate on the :math:`(x,y,z,e)` coordinates of a particular cut,
  evaluated using :mat:mod:`~sqw.@SQWDnDBase.func_eval` and similar functions.
- User model functions which operate on the :math:`(\mathbf{Q}, \omega)` coordinates,
  evaluated using :mat:mod:`~sqw.@SQWDnDBase.sqw_eval` and similar functions.

In the first case, for example, if the user makes a 1D cut along the :math:`\mathbf{Q}=(1,1,0)` direction,
and calls :mat:mod:`~sqw.@SQWDnDBase.func_eval` on this cut, a single vector of the values of
:math:`\sqrt{Q_h^2 + Q_k^2}` is passed to the user model function.
On the other hand, if she calls :mat:mod:`~sqw.@SQWDnDBase.sqw_eval` on this cut,
4 vectors, namely :math:`(Q_h, Q_k, Q_l, E)`, are passed to the user model function.
Generally, "simple" functions such as linear backgrounds or peak functions (Gaussians, Lorentzians, etc),
are used with :mat:mod:`~sqw.@SQWDnDBase.func_eval` whilst more complex models use
:mat:mod:`~sqw.@SQWDnDBase.sqw_eval`.
In particular the interface with external modelling codes described here exclusively use the second type.


Energy convolution
------------------

The :mat:mod:`~sqw.@SQWDnDBase.sqw_eval` function expects the user model function to return a single vector
:math:`S(Q_h, Q_k, Q_l, E)` of neutron intensity evaluated at the 4 reciprocal space coordinates.
However, in many cases calculations instead return pairs of values :math:`(E, I)`
of mode energy :math:`E` and intensity :math:`I` for a particular :math:`\mathbf{Q}=(Q_h, Q_k, Q_l)` point.
This is the case for phonon calculations, where at each :math:`\mathbf{Q}` point
a dynamical matrix is constructed whose eigenvalues are the mode energies squared
and whose eigenvectors can be used to calculate the dynamical structure factor which is proportional to :math:`I`.

In these cases, an energy convolution has to be performed to obtain :math:`S(Q_h, Q_k, Q_l, E)`.
This can be done with the :mat:mod:`~sqw.@SQWDnDBase.disp2sqw_eval` function.
This function passes the needed :math:`(Q_h, Q_k, Q_l)` to the model function
and performs an energy convolution using either:

- A fixed width peak function (Gaussian by default)

- Energy-variable width peak function, where the peak width varies with energy transfer

- A custom user defined shape function (for :math:`\mathbf{Q}` and :math:`E` dependent peak shapes).

Note that this energy convolution is required for *all* model functions which yields pairs
(energy :math:`E`, intensity :math:`I`) from an input set of :math:`\mathbf{Q}=(Q_h, Q_k, Q_l)` points.
For calculations which take into account
:ref:`the instrument resolution function <user_guide/Resolution_convolution:Resolution Convolution>`,
this energy convolution can be considered the "intrinsic" (lifetime) energy broadening of the excitation.


Euphonic example
----------------

.. _install_addons:

Installing Euphonic
...................

`Euphonic <https://euphonic.readthedocs.io/>`__ is a Python package to calculate phonon
inelastic neutron scattering (INS) intensities from force constants determined from *ab initio* calculations.
To use it with Horace, you should first download the
`Horace-Euphonic-Interface <https://horace-euphonic-interface.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__
which is available as a Matlab toolbox add-on.
This can be installed within Matlab by clicking on the "Home" tab in the control ribbon,
then clicking "Add-Ons" and "Get Add-Ons":

.. image:: ../images/get_h-eu_interface_01.png
   :width: 300px
   :alt: Accessing the Add-Ons menu in Matlab

Type ``euphonic`` in the search bar, and click on the ``horace-euphonic-interface`` package.

.. image:: ../images/get_h-eu_interface_02.png
   :width: 500px
   :alt: Installing the Horace-Euphonic-Interface Add-On

Then click "Add" in the next window (you may have to log into your Mathworks account).

If you prefer, you can download the `Horace-Euphonic-Interface` toolbox directly from
`here <https://github.com/pace-neutrons/horace-euphonic-interface/releases>`__
(download the latest ``mltbx`` file). Then run:

.. code-block:: matlab

    matlab.addons.toolbox.installToolbox('/path/to/mltbx_file')

Because `Euphonic` is a Python program, you need to have Python setup on your system,
and to tell Matlab about this.
Please see `here <https://horace-euphonic-interface.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#set-up-python-in-matlab>`__
for more detailed information.
Also, please note that there are restrictions on the supported Python versions for a given
Matlab version.
Please see `here <https://www.mathworks.com/support/requirements/python-compatibility.html>`__
for a table.

In addition, you should also have the `Euphonic` Python package installed in the Python
environment you have set up in Matlab. Please see details in the
`Euphonic installation instructions <https://euphonic.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html>`__.
We recommend using the Conda installation.

On the `IDAaaS system <https://isis.analysis.stfc.ac.uk/>`__, you can access the pre-installed
Euphonic Python environment using:

.. code-block:: matlab

    pyenv('Version', '/opt/euphonic/bin/python');

Note that this should be done at the start of a Matlab session.
If a different Python interpreter has already been started you will need to restart Matlab,
otherwise the above command will give an error.

To test that `Euphonic` has been installed correctly, run:

.. code-block:: matlab

    help(euphonic.ForceConstants)

Which will give you the (Python) help text on the :py:class:`~euphonic.force_constants.ForceConstants` class.
If `Euphonic` was not installed correctly, this command will give an error.


Running a Euphonic calculation with Horace
..........................................

To perform a phonon INS calculation Euphonic requires the force constants from an *ab initio* calculation.
Euphonic can read this information from either a `CASTEP <http://www.castep.org/>`__ ``.castep_bin`` file
using the :py:meth:`~euphonic.force_constants.ForceConstants.from_castep` method,
or a `Phonopy <https://phonopy.github.io/phonopy/>`__ output folder containing a ``phonopy.yaml`` file using the
:py:meth:`~euphonic.force_constants.ForceConstants.from_phonopy` method.

In addition to reading in the force constants, we must also set certain parameters for the INS calculation.
To do this we create a :py:class:`~euphonic_sqw_model.CoherentCrystal` object from the
:py:class:`~euphonic.force_constants.ForceConstants` data we read in.
This :py:class:`~euphonic_sqw_model.CoherentCrystal` has a method (function),
:py:meth:`~euphonic_sqw_model.CoherentCrystal.horace_disp` which can be passed to the Horace
:mat:mod:`~sqw.@SQWDnDBase.disp2sqw_eval` function.

The following code reads the force constants from a CASTEP file, sets up the
:py:class:`~euphonic_sqw_model.CoherentCrystal` object and then evaluate the phonon model on an experimental cut:

.. _sim_euphonic:

.. code-block:: matlab

   % Read force constants
   fc = euphonic.ForceConstants.from_castep('quartz.castep_bin')

   % Set up model
   coh_model = euphonic.CoherentCrystal(...
      fc, ...
      'conversion_mat', [1 0 0; 0 1 0; 0 0 -1], ...
      'debye_waller_grid', [6 6 6], ...
      'temperature', 100, ...
      'asr', 'reciprocal', ...
      'use_c', true);

   % Read in experimental cut
   cut = cut_sqw('quartz_cut.sqw', [-3.02, -2.98], [5, 0.5, 38])

   % Simulate
   scale_factor = 200;
   effective_fwhm = 1;
   cut_sim = disp2sqw_eval(...
      cut, @coh_model.horace_disp, {scale_factor}, effective_fwhm);

   % Plot
   plot(cut_sim);


.. note::

    The data files ``quartz.castep_bin`` and ``quartz_cut.sqw`` are available for download
    `here <https://github.com/pace-neutrons/pace-python-demo/blob/main/datafiles/>`__


- The ``conversion_mat`` parameter denotes a :math:`3 \times 3` matrix to transform from the :math:`q`-points
  in Horace to that used by the phonon model (i.e. that used in the *ab initio* calculation).
  This is needed if, for example, a primitive unit cell is used in the *ab initio* calculation
  but the Horace data is defined using a conventional unit cell.
  By default it is set to the identity matrix.

- The ``debye_waller_grid`` parameter is the size of the (Monkhorst-Pack) :math:`q`-space grid
  to use for the Brillouin zone integration needed to calculate the Debye-Waller factor.
  Higher values will yield a more accurate calculation but the :math:`6 \times 6 \times 6` grid
  is sufficient in most cases.

- The ``temperature`` is in Kelvin.

- The ``asr`` parameter specifies whether and how the *acoustic sum rule* (ASR) correction should be applied:

  * ``reciprocal`` applies the ASR correction to the dynamical matrix at every :math:`q`-point (recommended).

  * ``realspace`` applies the ASR correction to the force constant matrix in real space.
    This method is known to fail for polar systems.

  If this parameter is not specified, the ASR correction is not applied.
  This means that the phonon modes are not enforced to have zero energy at the :math:`\Gamma` point,
  and the dispersion close to :math:`\Gamma` may not be linear.
  It's generally best to specify it in the ``reciprocal`` mode.

- The ``use_c`` parameter specifies whether to use the compiled C extension module for faster calculation or not.

For further information and other options, type `help(euphonic.CoherentCrystal)` in the Matlab command window.


Fitting data with Euphonic and Horace
.....................................

Fitting in Horace uses the :ref:`multifit application <manual/Multifit:Multifit>`.
After running the :ref:`above code <sim_euphonic>`, a fit can be performed using:

.. code-block:: matlab

  kk = multifit_sqw(cut);
  kk = kk.set_fun(@disp2sqw, {@coh_model.horace_disp, {scale_factor}, effective_fwhm});
  [fitted_cut, fit_pars] = kk.fit();

Because `Euphonic` uses *ab initio* data, the only "fittable" parameters are scale factors.
By default, only the intensity scale factor is fitted to the data.
If you wish, you can also fit an overall energy scale factor, by giving an extra value in the input cell:

.. code-block:: matlab

  kk = kk.set_fun(@disp2sqw, {@coh_model.horace_disp, {[scale_factor energy_scale]}, ...
                  effective_fwhm});

This syntax is also ideally suited to simulating a phonon model with instrument resolution
convolution as described in :ref:`the last section <user_guide/Resolution_convolution:Resolution Convolution>`:

.. code-block:: matlab

  % Defines the sample geometry.
  is_crystal = true;
  xgeom = [0,0,1]; ygeom = [0,1,0];
  shape = 'cuboid'; shape_pars = [0.01,0.05,0.01];

  % Need to set the sample information inside the cut.
  cut = set_sample(cut, IX_sample(is_crystal, xgeom, ygeom, shape, shape_pars));

  % Do the same for the instrument information
  ei = 40; freq = 400; chopper = 'g';
  cut = set_instrument(cut, merlin_instrument(ei, freq, chopper));

  scalefac = 1e12;
  intrinsic_fwhm = 0.1;
  tt = 5;  % temperature in K

  kk = tobyfit(cut);
  kk = kk.set_fun(@disp2sqw, {@coh_model.horace_disp, {scale_factor}, intrinsic_fwhm});
  sim = kk.simulate('fore');

  % Plots the data (black points), non-resolution convoluted simulation (black lines)
  % and resolution-convoluted simulation (red lines)
  acolor black; plot(cut); pl(cut_sim); acolor red; pl(sim)

In this case, the energy width parameter is an *intrinsic* (lifetime) width instead of
an effective width which includes contribution from both instrument resolution as well as lifetime broadening.

SpinW example
-------------

Installing SpinW
................

`SpinW <https://spinw.org/>`__ is a Matlab program to calculate magnetic inelastic neutron spectra
using linear spin wave theory (LSWT).
It is available as an "Add-On", and can be installed similarly to the
:ref:`Horace-Euphonic-Interface <install_addons>` above (search for ``spinw`` instead of ``euphonic``!).

Alternatively, you can download the `zipped release distribution <https://github.com/SpinW/spinw/releases/latest>`__
and extract it to a folder and then add that folder to the Matlab path using ``addpath(genpath('/path/to/spinw'))``.


Running a SpinW calculation with Horace
.......................................

Similarly to the Euphonic :py:meth:`~euphonic_sqw_model.CoherentCrystal.horace_disp` method,
the `spinw class <https://spinw.org/spinw>`__ has a ``horace_sqw`` method
which is used as a gateway between SpinW and Horace.

``horace_sqw`` acts as a wrapper around the ``spinwave`` and ``sw_neutron`` functions
which carry out the actual spin wave INS calculations in SpinW.
In addition, it also carries out the energy convolution described in the `Energy convolution`_ section above.

A user should set up a SpinW model and then pass a handle (indicated by the ``@`` operator)
to the ``horace_sqw`` method to :mat:mod:`~sqw.@SQWDnDBase.sqw_eval`
or directly to a :ref:`multifit object <manual/Multifit:Multifit>`, for example:

.. code-block:: matlab

   % Set up a simple triangular lattice antiferromagnet model
   J = 1.2; K = 0.2; fwhm = 0.75; scalefactor = 1;
   tri = sw_model('triAF', J);
   tri.addmatrix('label', 'K', 'value', diag([0 0 K])); tri.addaniso('K');

   % Make a cut of some data
   ws = cut_sqw(sqw_file, [0.05], [-0.1, 0.1], [-0.1, 0.1], [0.5]);

   % Set up the fitting problem
   kk = multifit_sqw(ws);
   kk = kk.set_fun(@tri.horace_sqw);
   kk = kk.set_pin({[J K fwhm scalefactor], 'mat', {'J_1', 'K(3,3)'}, ...
                   'hermit', false, 'formfact', true, 'usefast', false,
                   'resfun', 'gauss'});

   % Run a simulation and then a fit
   ws_sim = kk.simulate();
   [ws_fit, fit_dat] = kk.fit()

Let's concentrate on the line where the input parameters and arguments are set:

.. code-block:: matlab

   kk = kk.set_pin({[J K fwhm scalefactor], 'mat', {'J_1', 'K(3,3)'}, ...
                   'hermit', false, 'formfact', true, 'usefast', false});

The convention in Horace is that if the parameters are given as a cell array,
then the first element *must* be a vector of fit parameters,
whilst everything else is passed unchanged to the model function (``horace_sqw`` in this case).
Thus, in this case we see that the fit parameters are ``[J K fwhm scalefactor]``.
The first two (``J`` and ``K``) are defined by the spinwave model
whilst the last two (``fwhm`` and ``scalefactor``) are defined by ``horace_sqw``'s energy convolution routines.
By default, a fixed width convolution with a Gaussian is performed,
but ``horace_sqw`` takes an argument ``resfun`` which can be used to specify a different peak function:

- ``'resfun', 'gauss'`` - a Gaussian peak (two parameter: ``fwhm`` and ``scalefactor``) [default]
- ``'resfun', 'lor'`` - a Lorentzian peak (two parameter: ``fwhm`` and ``scalefactor``)
- ``'resfun', 'voigt'`` - a pseudo-Voigt peak (3 parameters: ``fwhm``, ``lorentzian_fraction`` and ``scalefactor``)
- ``'resfun', 'sho'`` - a damped harmonic oscillator (3 parameters: ``Gamma``, ``Temperature`` and ``Amplitude``)
- ``'resfun', @fun_handle`` - a function handle to a function which will be accepted by Horace's ``disp2sqw`` method

Note that the different options to ``resfun`` changes the number of parameters which should be set by Horace.
For example, if there are :math:`n` spinwave model parameters and the user specifies the ``sho`` peak function,
they should pass :math:`n+3` parameters (intrinsic width :math:`\Gamma`, sample temperature and an intensity amplitude)

A SpinW model can contain a lot of parameters
and furthermore defines the exchange and anisotropy in terms of :math:`3 \times 3` tensors,
whilst Horace accepts only scalar parameters.
In order to specify which SpinW model parameters should be fitted by Horace,
users should use the ``mat`` and ``selector`` arguments. If there are :math:`n` parameters to be fitted then:

- ``mat`` is an :math:`n`-element cell array of the matrix names defined in the SpinW model,
- ``selector`` is a :math:`3 \times 3 \times n` array of logical indices indicating which element of the named matrix should be fitted.

For simple cases where only one scalar value of each named matrix should be fitted then ``selector`` is not needed.
This is the case for Heisenberg interactions and simple single-ion anisotropy along one of the :math:`xyz` axes defined by the SpinW model.
That was the case above where ``'mat', {'J_1', 'K(3,3)'}`` indicates that:

- The first Horace-fittable parameter ``p(1)`` corresponds to the ``J_1`` named matrix and that matrix should be set to ``eye(3)*p(1)``.
- The second Horace-fittable parameter ``p(2)`` corresponds to the ``K`` named matrix and that one the matrix element should be set as ``K(3,3)=p(2)``.

For example, if the user wants two independent axial anisotropies along the :math:`x` and :math:`z` directions,
they can set ``'mat', {'K(1,1)', 'K(3,3)'}``, indicating that the first parameter ``p(1)`` is the :math:`x` direction
anisotropy and the second parameter ``p(2)`` is the :math:`z` direction anisotropy.

In more complex cases, for example for a DM interaction where multiple elements of a named matrix are dependent,
the ``selector`` argument should be given:

.. code-block:: matlab

   vec = [0.1 0.2 0.3];
   swobj.addmatrix('label', 'DM', 'value', Dvec);
   swobj.addcoupling('mat', 'DM', 'bond', 1);

   sel(:,:,1) = [0 0 0; 0 0 1; 0 -1 0];    % Dx
   sel(:,:,2) = [0 0 1; 0 0 0; -1 0 0];    % Dy
   sel(:,:,3) = [0 1 0; -1 0 0; 0 0 0];    % Dz

   kk.set_fun(@swobj.horace_sqw);
   kk.set_pin({Dvec, 'mat', {'DM', 'DM', 'DM'}, ...
       'selector', sel, 'hermit', false})
   kk.fit()

In this example, the 3 parameters to be varied by Horace are the elements of the DM vector
in the Cartesian :math:`x`, :math:`y`, :math:`z`, directions defined by the SpinW model.
In each case, two elements of the ``DM`` matrix should be varied together, which is indicated by the ``sel`` array.

In addition to ``mat`` and ``selector``, ``horace_sqw`` also takes some other arguments:

- ``'usefast'`` - This tells ``horace_sqw`` to use a faster, more memory efficient but slightly less accurate code than ``spinwave``. In particular, this code achieves its speed gain and lower memory usage by:

    * Only calculating the perpendicular component :math:`S_{\text{perp}}` rather than the full :math:`S^{\alpha\beta}`
      spin-spin correlation tensor, as neutron scattering is only sensitive to :math:`S_{\text{perp}}`.
    * Only calculating magnon creation (positive energy / neutron energy loss) modes.

- ``'coordtrans'`` - A :math:`4 \times 4` matrix to transform the input :math:`(Q_h,Q_k,Q_l,\hbar\omega)` coordinates received from Horace before passing to SpinW

.. note::

   The ``usefast`` option may not work correctly for models which defines an incommensurate magnetic structure.
   We recommend checking the calculations with ``'usefast', false`` before using it in production.

Finally, any argument used by the `spinwave method <https://spinw.org/spinw_spinwave>`__,
such as ``'hermit', false`` can be passed in the parameters cell array.
More information is available in the online help: type ``doc spinw/horace_sqw`` in Matlab.


Worked example with resolution convolution
..........................................

The code below is a fully working script for the material, :math:`\mathrm{Pr(Ca, Sr)_2Mn_2O_7}`,
which is a half-doped bilayer manganite with an intriguing magnetic ground state.
This was the subject of differing models of the exchange interactions deduced from diffraction data
and was eventually resolved by inelastic neutron measurements.
For details, please see `G.E. Johnstone et al. <https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.109.237202>`__
and `R. A. Ewings et al. <https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.94.014405>`__.

The following code simulates a 2D slice with resolution convolution using the parameters found by `Johnstone et al.`
The `SpinW` model can be downloaded `here <https://spinw.org/RealWorldExample/matlab/prcasrmn2o7.m>`__
and the data file is `here <https://github.com/pace-neutrons/pace-python-demo/blob/main/datafiles/pcsmo_cut1.sqw>`__.

.. code-block:: matlab

   % Create a cut of the data
   proj = line_proj([1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], 'type', 'rrr')
   w1 = cut_sqw('pcsmo_cut1.sqw', proj, [-1, 0.05, 1], [-1, 0.05, 1], [-10, 10], [10, 20])

   % Defines the sample and instrument parameters
   sample = IX_sample(true,[0,0,1],[0,1,0],'cuboid',[0.01,0.05,0.01]);
   maps = maps_instrument(70, 300, 'S');

   % Defines the spin wave model
   JF1 = -11.39; JA = 1.5; JF2 = -1.35; JF3 = 1.5; Jperp = 0.88; D = 0.074;
   cpars = {'mat', {'JF1', 'JA', 'JF2', 'JF3', 'Jperp', 'D(3,3)'}, ...
       'hermit', false, 'optmem', 0, 'useFast', false, 'formfact', true, ...
       'resfun', 'gauss', 'coordtrans', diag([2 2 1 1])};

   % Define the SpinW model in a separate script file to save space
   % The script creates a spinw object called `pcsmo`
   prcasrmn2o7;

   % Adds twin info, also means we can't use ('usefast', true)
   pcsmo.addtwin('axis', [0 0 1], 'phid', 90)

   % Mask 90% (keep 10%) of detector pixels to speed up calculation time
   w1 = mask_random_fraction_pixels(w1, 0.1);

   % Set up the resolution convolution calculation
   w1 = set_sample(w1, sample);
   w1 = set_instrument(w1, maps);
   tbf = tobyfit(w1);
   tbf = tbf.set_fun (@pcsmo.horace_sqw, {[JF1 JA JF2 JF3 Jperp D 0.1] cpars{:}});
   tbf = tbf.set_mc_points(5);
   ws_sim = tbf.simulate();

   plot(w1); keep_figure; plot(ws_sim)

The calculation takes around 5 minutes (~1h without masking).

Generic interface
-----------------

As we saw from the examples above, the Horace :ref:`multifit application <manual/Multifit:Multifit>`
expects a model function to have the following signature:

.. code-block:: matlab

   I = function user_model(qh, qk, ql, en, parameters, varargin)

where ``qh``, ``qk``, ``ql``, and ``en`` are :math:`n_{\mathrm{pix}}`-length vectors denoting the
coordinates of the pixels of a Horace ``sqw`` object, or the bin centres of a ``dnd`` object.
The function should return an :math:`n_{\mathrm{pix}}`-length vector ``I`` of neutron intensities at those coordinates.
``parameters`` is a vector of the current iteration's fittable parameter values, and
``varargin`` is an optional cell array denoting a variable-length argument list,
using `standard Matlab syntax <https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/varargin.html>`__.

This function is passed to a ``multifit`` object using the ``set_fun`` method,
and its initial parameters set using the ``set_pin`` method:

.. code-block:: matlab

   kk = multifit(ws);
   kk = kk.set_fun(@user_model);
   kk = kk.set_pin({parameters, varargin{:}});

If there are no arguments to be passed (e.g. ``varargin`` should be empty), then a vector rather
a cell array can be passed to ``set_pin``:

.. code-block:: matlab

   kk = kk.set_pin(parameters);

In the following sections we describe how user defined model functions in several different languages
can be used with the :ref:`multifit application <manual/Multifit:Multifit>` in Horace.
We will use the example of spin waves in bcc-Iron, where the scattering function is given by:

.. math::

   S(q_h, q_k, q_l, E) &= \frac{I_0}{\pi} \frac{4\Gamma E_0}{(E^2 - E_0^2)^2 - 4(\Gamma E)^2} \mathcal{N} \mathcal{F}

   \\

   E_0(q_h, q_k, q_l, E) &= \Delta + 8 J \left(1 - \cos(\pi q_h) \cos(\pi q_k) \cos(\pi q_l) \right)

   \mathcal{N}(E) &= \frac{E}{1 - \exp \left( - \frac{E}{k_B T} \right)}

   \mathcal{F}(q) &= A \exp(-a q^2) + B \exp(-b q^2) + C \exp(-c q^2) + D


where :math:`I_0` is an amplitude (intensity scaling) parameter,
:math:`\Gamma` is an energy width parameter, :math:`\Delta` is an energy gap parameter,
and :math:`J` is an exchange parameter to be fitted.
Thus :math:`E_0(\mathbf{Q})` is the *dispersion relation*, :math:`\mathcal{N}(E)` is the thermal population (Bose) factor
where :math:`k_B` is Boltzmann's constant and :math:`T` the sample temperature.
:math:`F(q)` is the magnetic form factor for metallic iron with :math:`q = \sqrt{q_h^2 + q_k^2 + q_l^2}/(4a^2)`,
where :math:`a=2.87~\text{Å}` is the lattice parameter of bcc-Iron and the parameters are :math:`A=0.0706`, :math:`a=35.008`,
:math:`B=0.3589`, :math:`b=15.358`, :math:`C=0.5819`, :math:`c=5.561`, and :math:`D=-0.0114`.

Matlab function
...............

The simplest case is for a model function written in Matlab.
Put the following into a file called ``fe_sqw.m``:

.. code-block:: matlab

   function out = fe_sqw(h, k, l, e, p)

   js = p(1); d = p(2); gamma = p(3); I0 = p(4); temperature = p(5);

   E0 = d + (8*js) .* (1 - cos(pi * h) .* cos(pi * k) .* cos(pi * l));
   q2 = (h.^2 + k.^2 + l.^2) ./ ((2*2.87)^2);

   % The magnetic form factor of iron
   A=0.0706; a=35.008;  B=0.3589; b=15.358;  C=0.5819; c=5.561;  D=-0.0114;
   ff = A * exp(-a*q2) + B * exp(-b*q2) + C * exp(-c*q2) + D;

   out = (ff.^2) .* (I0/pi) .* (e ./ (1-exp(-11.602*e/temperature))) ...
         .* (4 * gamma * E0) ./ ((e.^2 - E0.^2).^2 + 4*(gamma * e).^2);

For simplicity we have passed the sample temperature as a fit variable but it should be fixed in the fitting:

.. code-block:: matlab

   % Make a cut of the data
   proj = line_proj([1,1,0], [-1,1,0], 'type', 'rrr');
   w_fe = cut_sqw('fe_cut.sqw', proj, [-3,0.05,3], [-1.05,-0.95], [-0.05,0.05], [70, 90]);

   % Define starting parameters
   J = 35;     % Exchange interaction in meV
   D = 0;      % Single-ion anisotropy in meV
   gam = 30;   % Intrinsic linewidth in meV (inversely proportional to excitation lifetime)
   temp = 10;  % Sample measurement temperature in Kelvin
   amp = 300;  % Magnitude of the intensity of the excitation (arbitrary units)

   % Define the fitting problem
   kk = multifit_sqw(w_fe)
   kk = kk.set_fun (@fe_sqw, [J, D, gam, amp, temp])
   kk = kk.set_free ([1, 1, 1, 1, 0])
   kk = kk.set_bfun (@linear_bg, [0.1, 0])
   kk = kk.set_bfree ([1, 0])

   [wfit, fitdata] = kk.fit()
   plot(w_fe); pl(wfit);

Note that we have used an alternative syntax for ``set_fun`` where the initial parameter is also set and then
forced the sample temperature (the 5th parameter) to be fixed during the fitting with ``kk = kk.set_free([1,1,1,1,0])``.

Alternatively we could have defined the function to take the temperature as an extra argument and only have 4 fittable parameters:

.. code-block:: matlab

   function out = fe_sqw(h, k, l, e, p, temperature)
   js = p(1); d = p(2); gamma = p(3); I0 = p(4);

Then the fitting code would be:

.. code-block:: matlab

   kk = multifit_sqw(w_fe)
   kk = kk.set_fun (@fe_sqw, {[J, D, gam, amp] temp})


Python function
...............

If your model function is defined in Python, or requires the use of Python modules,
it is still possible to call it in Horace using the
`in-built Python calling facility <https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/call-python-libraries.html>`__ of Matlab.
This is accessed using the ``py.`` namespace.

For example, let us define a Python file called ``fe_module.py`` with the following function:

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np

   def fe_function(h, k, l, e, p, temperature):
       js = p[0]; d = p[1]; gamma = p[2]; I0 = p[3]
       E0 = d + (8*js) * (1 - np.cos(np.pi * h) * np.cos(np.pi * k) * np.cos(np.pi * l))
       q2 =  (h**2 + k**2 + l**2) / ((2*2.87)**2)
       # The magnetic form factor of iron
       A=0.0706; a=35.008;  B=0.3589; b=15.358;  C=0.5819; c=5.561;  D=-0.0114;
       ff = A * np.exp(-a*q2) + B * np.exp(-b*q2) + C * np.exp(-c*q2) + D
       return (ff**2) * (I0/np.pi) * (e / (1-np.exp(-11.602*e/temperature))) \
              * (4 * gamma * E0) / ((e**2 - E0**2)**2 + 4*(gamma * e)**2)

Because :ref:`multifit <manual/Multifit:Multifit>` expects a *Matlab* function handle,
we must now wrap this Python function in a Matlab *anonymous function* (equivalent to a Python *lambda* function):

.. code-block:: matlab

   fe_sqw_py = @(h,k,l,e,p,temperature) double(py.fe_module.fe_function( ...
                py.numpy.array(h), py.numpy.array(k), py.numpy.array(l), ...
                py.numpy.array(e), py.numpy.array(p), temperature));
   kk = multifit_sqw(w_fe)
   kk = kk.set_fun (fe_sqw_py, {[J, D, gam, amp] temp})
   kk = kk.set_bfun (@linear_bg, [0.1, 0])
   kk = kk.set_bfree ([1, 0])
   [wfit, fitdata] = kk.fit();


C / C++ / Fortran function
..........................

Finally, we can also call compiled functions written in C, C++ or Fortran from Matlab
but there are some limitations:

* We use the `loadlibrary <https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/loadlibrary.html>`__ Matlab function,
  which expects a "C-style" shared library. This means that C++ functions must be declared with ``extern "C"``
  and Fortran 90 functions must be declared with the ``bind(C)`` attribute
  (this means that Fortran 77 or earlier is not supported).
* This also means that the function must be compiled as a shared-object (``.so``) library
  (dynamically-linked library (``.dll``) in Windows).
* To ensure that there are no heap memory errors, and to avoid slow-downs in copying large arrays,
  the model function *must* use an pre-allocated array for the results
  and should not allocate any arrays itself to return to Matlab
  (e.g. C/C++ functions must return ``void`` and Fortran must functions must be declared as ``subroutine``).
* To allow the same interface for C/C++ and Fortran, the C/C++ functions must pass by reference.

In addition, for the examples below we restrict to the case where no non-variable arguments are specified
(e.g. the first Matlab example where the temperature is included in the set of "variable" parameters
but is fixed by ``set_free``).
This is not a general restriction but including such a facility is complex and may not be needed in most cases.
There is `some discussion here <https://github.com/pace-neutrons/pace-developers/blob/master/optimisation/design/Third_Party_API_Design.md#-non-variable-parameters-in-compiled-user-models>`__
of how this could be done, and the interested user should contact a Horace developer for further help.


Prerequisites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Like the Python model function described above, we need to have a Matlab wrapper function:

.. code-block:: matlab

   function out = compiled_model(h, k, l, en, p, libname, funcname)
       res = libpointer('doublePtr', h);
       if ~libisloaded(libname)
           temp_header = [tempname(), '.h'];
           fid = fopen(temp_header, 'w');
           fprintf(fid, ['void %s(const double *qh, const double *qk, const double *ql, ' ...
                         'const double *en, const double *parameters, double *result, ' ...
                         'int *n_elem);'], funcname);
           fclose(fid);
           loadlibrary(libname, temp_header);
       end
       calllib(libname, funcname, h, k, l, en, p, res, numel(h));
       out = res.value;
   end

Put the above code into a file ``compiled_model.m``. Note that:

* The function requires a ``libname`` which is the name of the compiled shared library
  (a ``.so`` file in Linux or ``.dll`` file in Windows) without the extension.
  This library file must be on the Matlab path.
* The Matlab `loadlibrary function <https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/loadlibrary.html>`__
  is used to automatically load the library so it is not necessary for you to manually load it.
* The Matlab `libpointer function <https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/libpointer.html>`__
  is used to create an empty array ``res`` to hold the calculated intensity from the function.
* Because the compiled function is passed as *pointers* to the arrays, it needs to know their size,
  hence the final argument in the call to ``calllib`` is ``numel(h)``, the number of array elements.


C example
^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: c

   #include <math.h>

   void fe_c_func(const double *qh, const double *qk, const double *ql, const double *en,
                  const double *parameters, double *result, int *n_elem)
   {
       const double js = parameters[0];
       const double d = parameters[1];
       const double gam = parameters[2];
       const double amp = parameters[3] / M_PI;
       const double tt = parameters[4];
       const double js8 = 8 * js;
       const double qscal = pow(1./(2.*2.87), 2.);
       const double A=0.0706, a=35.008, B=0.3589, b=15.358, C=0.5819, c=5.561, D=-0.0114;

       double E0, q2, ff, e2E02, game;
       for (int i=0; i<*n_elem; i++) {
           E0 = d + js8 * (1. - cos(M_PI * qh[i]) * cos(M_PI * qk[i]) * cos(M_PI * ql[i]));
           q2 = qscal * (qh[i]*qh[i] + qk[i]*qk[i] + ql[i]*ql[i]);
           ff = A * exp(-a * q2) + B * exp(-b * q2) + C * exp(-c * q2) + D;
           e2E02 = (en[i]*en[i] - E0*E0);
           game = gam * en[i];
           result[i] = (ff * ff) * amp * (en[i] / (1 - exp(-11.602*en[i] / tt)))
                       * (4 * gam * E0) / (e2E02*e2E02 + 4 * game * game);
       }

   }

Put the above code into a file called ``fe_sqw.c`` and compile it with:

.. code-block:: sh

   gcc -shared -o fe_sqw_c.so fe_sqw.c

Put the compiled library file into a folder on the Matlab path, and run the fit with:

.. code-block:: matlab

   kk = multifit_sqw(w_fe)
   kk = kk.set_fun (@compiled_model, {[J, D, gam, amp, temp], 'fe_sqw_c', 'fe_c_func'})
   kk = kk.set_free ([1, 1, 1, 1, 0])
   kk = kk.set_bfun (@linear_bg, [0.1, 0])
   kk = kk.set_bfree ([1, 0])
   [wfit, fitdata] = kk.fit();


C++ example
^^^^^^^^^^^

Create a file ``fe_sqw.cpp`` with:

.. code-block:: cpp

   #include <cmath>

   extern "C" {

   void fe_cpp_func(const double *qh, const double *qk, const double *ql, const double *en,
                    const double *parameters, double *result, int *n_elem)
   {
       const double js = parameters[0];
       const double d = parameters[1];
       const double gam = parameters[2];
       const double amp = parameters[3] / M_PI;
       const double tt = parameters[4];
       const double js8 = 8 * js;
       const double qscal = pow(1./(2.*2.87), 2.);
       const double A=0.0706, a=35.008, B=0.3589, b=15.358, C=0.5819, c=5.561, D=-0.0114;

       double E0, q2, ff, e2E02, game;
       for (int i=0; i<*n_elem; i++) {
           E0 = d + js8 * (1. - cos(M_PI * qh[i]) * cos(M_PI * qk[i]) * cos(M_PI * ql[i]));
           q2 = qscal * (qh[i]*qh[i] + qk[i]*qk[i] + ql[i]*ql[i]);
           ff = A * exp(-a * q2) + B * exp(-b * q2) + C * exp(-c * q2) + D;
           e2E02 = (en[i]*en[i] - E0*E0);
           game = gam * en[i];
           result[i] = (ff * ff) * amp * (en[i] / (1 - exp(-11.602*en[i] / tt)))
                       * (4 * gam * E0) / (e2E02*e2E02 + 4 * game * game);
       }

   }

   } // extern "C"

Compile it using:

.. code-block:: sh

   g++ -shared -o fe_sqw_cpp.so fe_sqw.cpp

Put the compiled library file into a folder on the Matlab path, and run the fit with the
same script as above, except that the function is now:

.. code-block:: matlab

   kk = kk.set_fun (@compiled_model, {[J, D, gam, amp, temp], 'fe_sqw_cpp', 'fe_cpp_func'})
