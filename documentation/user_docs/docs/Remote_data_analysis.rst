Some users may not have sufficient computing power available (see :ref:`System Requirements <Download_and_setup:System requirements>`) to run Horace. With this is in mind we have installed Horace on the "Melehan", "Rutherford" and "Chadwick" Linux servers at Isis. If you need to use these machines for your data analysis, then please get in touch with the local contact for your experiment, or `Horace Help <mailto:horacehelp@stfc.ac.uk>`__ for more information.
