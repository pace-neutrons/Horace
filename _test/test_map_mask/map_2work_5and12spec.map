% Map file: 2 workspaces, 5 and 12 spectra respectively
2 	% number of workspaces

99 	% First workspace name
5 	% Number of spectra in the workspace: should be [2,3,4,11,13]
11 13 	% spectrum numbers - first line
2-4		% spectrum numbers - second line

% And now the second workspace. Same format with spectra over multiple lines
% Should be spectra [1,3,5,7,16,19,22,23,24,25,36,40]
