Using Run Inspector
###################

This is a tutorial to explore some of the diagnostic features in
Horace that allow you to understand strange features in your data.

This will take you through all the steps from generation, spurion
spotting, and analysis.

Generating data
===============

::

   %Take a cut from an sqw file, to get a dispersion plot. Ensure we do not
   %select the -nopix option, i.e. the object "cs" will be larger in memory,

   %but will retain all of the information about detector pixels from
   %individual runs (sample orientations) during the experiment.

   sqw_file='/mnt/data/Science/URu2Si2/data/sqw/Ei81_20K.sqw';

   proj = line_proj([1, 0 ,0], [0, 1, 0]);

   cs=cut(sqw_file,proj,[-0.05,0.05],[-4,0.04,-2],[-0.05,0.05], [0,0.8,20]);

   %Plot this:
   %we use the "compact" routine to ensure we get tight axes around the data, without too much white space
   plot(compact(cs));

   lz 0 100;
   keep_figure;

   Step 1 of 1; Have read data for 488866 pixels -- now processing data... -----> retained 24161 pixels

This is not very exciting, but notice there is an intense streak at
K=-3, E=8. Is this real, or a spurion? One way to find out is to use
the run inspector tool. This plots out the contributions to a cut from
each of the individual runs (so long as you retained the detector
pixel info, as we have here).

Run inspector
=============

::

   %Invoke the run inspector:
   run_inspector(cs,'ax',[-4,-2,0,20],'col',[0,100]);

.. note::

   The option ``ax`` sets the limits of the plot as follows: [xmin,
   xmax, ymin, ymax].

   If you don't do this, then data from each run will be plotted with
   different axes, which makes them quite hard to compare.

.. note::

   The option ``col`` sets the colourmap scale [col_min,col_max]. Again,
   not setting this means data from each run will be plotted with
   different colour scale, which is not so useful.

.. note::

   You can explore the data, toggling between runs using the arrow keys,
   and the page-up / page-down keys to skip 10 runs ahead.

Notice that the value of psi and the run number from when you made the
data file are given in the plot title.

You should find that run 14 (psi=26) has a high point in the region
we're worried about. But runs 89 and 90 (psi=25 and 26), 150
(psi=26.5) and 209 (psi=25.5) do not have this feature.

This suggests that it is a spurion. We can test this by masking the
data just from this run in our object:

.. note::

   the 14 here corresponds to the 14th run in our complete dataset

::


   cs_m = mask_runs(cs,14);
   plot(compact(cs_m));

   keep_figure

and this confirms that indeed it was a spurion.

Understanding data from a single orientation
============================================

If you have a material which is strongly 1d or 2d you may well only
measure with the sample in a single orientation. You can then
integrate between +/- infinity on the axes where there is no
dispersion.  This improves statistics without the need to count lots
of different orientations and hence is much faster.

Generating data
---------------

Generate a suitable sqw file, from a single orientation (see Taylor et
al) for an explanation of the science of this particular material.

.. note::

   Below is an old style ``.spe`` file, so we need to supply a
   ``.par`` file that gives info about the angular positions of the
   detector elements.  For modern ``.nxspe`` files this information is
   already included and the ``par`` argument to ``gen_sqw`` can be an
   empty string.


::

   spe_file='/mnt/data/Science/Cs245/data/MER11499_one2one_113.spe';
   par_file='/usr/local/mprogs/InstrumentFiles/trunk/merlin/one2one_113.par';

   alatt=[2.8,2.8,7.7];
   angdeg=[90,90,90];
   psi=-90;  %single orientation

   u=[1,1,0];
   v=[0,0,1];

   sqw_file2='/mnt/data/Science/Cs245/data/CsFeSe.sqw';
   omega=0;
   dpsi=0;
   gl=0;
   gs=0;

   gen_sqw(spe_file,par_file,sqw_file2,40,1,alatt,angdeg,u,v,psi,omega,dpsi,gl,gs);

   %Take a cut to show how the data look:
   ccs=cut(sqw_file2,proj,[-1,0.02,1],[0.25,0.35],[-Inf,Inf],
   [0,0.8,40]);
   plot(ccs)
   lz 0 20
   keep_figure

``coordinates_calc``
--------------------

There is a routine in Horace called ``coordinates_calc``, in which the
signal array in your data object is replaced by a value corresponding
to a Q or energy coordinate. Here we plot L (the direction we've
integrated along +/- inf here) to see what the value is explicitly as
we go up in energy

::

   ccs_L = coordinates_calc(ccs,'L');
   plot(ccs_L)
   keep_figure

Notice that L is coupled to energy transfer. So this means as we
increase energy we increase L, and hence :math:`\left|Q\right|`, which
means the signal will be decreased due to the magnetic form factor.

::

   %Can see this alternatively by plotting |Q|
   ccs_Q = coordinates_calc(ccs,'Q');
   plot(ccs_Q)
   keep_figure

``hkle``
--------

We can also get a list of h,k,l and e explicitly for a set of coordinates:

.. note::

   Here the 2nd argument is of the form [x1,y1; x2,y2; x3,y3;....]

::

   [qe1,qe2] = hkle(ccs,[0.11 14; 0.11 18; 0.11 22; 0.11 26; 0.11 30; 0.11 34]);

::

   >> qe1

   qe1 =

   0.1100 0.3000 1.1332 14.0000
   0.1100 0.3000 1.4891 18.0000
   0.1100 0.3000 1.8809 22.0000
   0.1100 0.3000 2.3225 26.0000
   0.1100 0.3000 2.8396 30.0000
   0.1100 0.3000 3.4932 34.0000

   >> qe2

   qe2 =

   0.1100 0.3000 9.6355 14.0000
   0.1100 0.3000 9.2796 18.0000
   0.1100 0.3000 8.8878 22.0000
   0.1100 0.3000 8.4462 26.0000
   0.1100 0.3000 7.9291 30.0000
   0.1100 0.3000 7.2755 34.0000


This tells us the values of h,k,l and e. As we saw above, the value of
L changes as we increase energy (``qe1``).  But what is ``qe2``? This
is the 2nd root, and corresponds to an alternative value of L that
could also contribute to the data here.

Putting it all together
-----------------------

To understand what this means let's plot a couple of constant energy
slices:

::

   ccs2 = cut(sqw_file2,proj,0.02,[0.25,0.35],0.05,[32,36]);
   plot(compact(ccs2))
   lz 0 20
   keep_figure

   ccs3 = cut(sqw_file2,proj,0.02,0.02,[-Inf,Inf],[32,36]);
   plot(compact(ccs3))
   lz 0 10
   lx 0 0.8
   ly 0 0.8

::

   Taking cut from data in file /mnt/data/Science/Cs245/data/CsFeSe.sqw...
   Step 1 of 1; Have read data for 6672330 pixels -- now processing data... -----> retained 73281 pixels
   Taking cut from data in file /mnt/data/Science/Cs245/data/CsFeSe.sqw...
   Step 1 of 1; Have read data for 6672330 pixels -- now processing data... -----> retained 635460 pixels

In the first of these slices, ``ccs2``, we've changed the plot axes to be H
and L. You can see that the detectors describe a curved path in the H,L
plane, so for a given H, if we integrate between +/- infinity then we
might also pick up info from a much higher 2-theta.

In this case you can see this starts to become a problem for this
particular MERLIN dataset around :math:`H > 0.35`.

The second slice, ``ccs3``, illustrates this in practice. You can see that
at :math:`Q=(0.35,0.3)` there is a step increase in the signal. This is
because we suddenly start to fold in the data from higher Q (phonon
signal).

To avoid this, we can set the limits of L in our original slice
explicitly. Generally the workflow here is to do the integration
between +/- infinity, and then figure out where in L you start to get
a problem, and then restrict the range of L to avoid this:

::

   ccs4 = cut(sqw_file2,proj,0.02,0.02,[0,4],[32,36]);
   plot(compact(ccs4))
   lz 0 10
   lx 0 0.8
   ly 0 0.8
   keep_figure
