function wout = rebunch (win,varargin)
% Bunch together the bins in a one dimensional dataset
%
% Syntax:
%   >> wout = rebunch (win, nbunch)
%
% Input:
% ------
%   win     Input dataset or array of datasets
%   nbunch  Sets the number of bins to be bunched together along
%          each axis
%           If the original number of bins along an an axis is not an integer
%          multiple of nbunch, then the final bin of the output data set is
%          correspondingly enlarged.
%
% Output:
% -------
%   wout    Rebunched data structure
%
%
% EXAMPLE
%   >> wout = rebunch (win, 2)
%   >> wout = rebunch (win, [2,4])
