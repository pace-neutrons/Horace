function wout = split(w,varargin)
% Split an sqw object into an array of sqw objects, each made from a
% single spe or nxspe data set
%
%   >> wout = split(w)
%
% Input:
% ------
%   w        --  Input sqw object
% Optional:
%  folder_for_parts
%            --  The string contains full path to the folder where to place
%                sqw files representing parts of the sqw file to split.
%               - If the variable is absent the files will be placed in working
%                 directory.
%               - If operation is performed in memory only, this path is ignored.
%               - If this folder is provided, the resulting files are
%                 assumed permanent files, so are not getting deleted when
%                 their correspondent sqw objects are getting deleted from
%                 memory.
% Optional keys:
%  '-files'  -- if provided, returns list of sqw files instead of sqw
%               objects. When split objects do not fit memory, they are all
%               stored in files and split returns list of the files.
%               When '-files' option is provided the split returns files
%               instead of objects in any situation.
%  '-filebacked'
%           -- if provided, request split object to be filebacked
%              regardless of the possibility to place them in memory.
%              If split object' images do not fit memory, this option
%              is ignored and the code behaves as if option '-files' is
%              specified.
%
% Output:
% -------
%   wout    Array of sqw objects, each one made from a single spe data file
%
%           If all images from split files do not fit memory, wout would be
%           the list of filenames, referring to sqw files with contents of
%           the split objects.
% NOTE:
% if results is filebacked or list of files, the resulting files or files-bases
% for filebacked objects are placed in the 'folder_for_parts' directory or in
% working directory if 'folder_for_path' is not provided.
% The names of partial files are build from the name of the original sqw
% file with added suffix containing corresponding run_id.
%
% For example: If you have initial sqw file Fe400mEv.sqw containing runs
% 32400,32401 and 32402 and split it in filebacked mode, the folder
% provided to keep result would contain files Fe400mEv_runID0032400.sqw,
% Fe400mEv_runID0032401.sqw and Fe400mEv_runID0032402.sqw
