% Input:
% ------
%   win     sqw object
%   xp_in   Row vector length np, or n x np array, where np is the number of 
%          plot axes, and n the number of points
%
% Output:
% -------
%   xp      Row vector length np, or n x np array, where n is now the 
%          number of retained points, that is, ones which lie in the range
%          of the data and which lie in bins that have at least one pixel
%   ipix    Column vector, length n, with the corresponding indicies of the
%          nearest pixel to each point.
%           The nearest pixel is defined as that which has minimum distance
%          in terms of step size along each axis from the point defined by
%          xp along the plot axes and median coordinate of the pixels along
%          the integration axes.
