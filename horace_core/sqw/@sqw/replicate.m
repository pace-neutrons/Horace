function wout = replicate (win,wref)
% Make a higher dimensional dataset from a two dimensional dataset by
% replicating the data along the extra dimensions of a reference dataset.
%
%   >> wout = replicate (win, wref)
%
% Input:
% ------
%   win     sqw object or array of sqw objects all with the same dimensionality
%           to be replicated. The signal and npix array will be
%           replicated  over the extra dimensions of the reference dataset,
%           but not the individual pixels.
%
%   wref    Reference dataset structure to use as template for expanding the
%           input straucture. Can be a dnd or sqw dataset.
%           - The plot axes of win must also be plot axes of wref, and the number
%           of points along these common axes must be the same, although the
%           numerical values of the coordinates need not be the same.
%           - The data is expanded along the plot axes of wref that are
%           integration axes of win.
%           - The annotations etc. are taken from the reference dataset.
%
% Output:
% -------
%   wout    Output dataset object (or array of objects). It is dnd object
%           with the same dimensionality as wref.
