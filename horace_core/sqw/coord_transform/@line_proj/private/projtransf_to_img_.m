% The projection axes are three vectors that may or may not be orthogonal
% which are used to create the bins in an sqw object.
%
% Input:
% ------
%   proj   line_proj object containing information about the transformation

%
% Output:
% -------
%   q_to_img    Matrix to convert components of a vector expressed
%               in Crystal Cartesian coordinate system to the components 
%               along the image axes
%               u1,u2,u3, as multiples of the step size along those axes
%                   Vstep(i) = rlu_to_ustep(i,j)*Vrlu(j)
%   ulen        Row vector of scales of ui in Ang^-1
%   b_mat       Matrix transforming hkl coordinate system into Crystal
%               Cartesian coordinate system
%   obj         the projection object iteslf modified if necessary so that
