function write_npix_to_pix_blocks_(obj,fout,pix_out_position,pix_comb_info)
% take pixels from the contributing files and place them into final sqw
% file pixels block
%
% Inputs:
% fout             -- filehandle or filename of target sqw file
% pix_out_position -- the position where pixels should be located in the
%                     target binary file
% pix_comb_info    -- the class containing the information about the input
%                     files to combine, namely the fields:
%
%   infiles         Cell array of file names, or array of file identifiers of open files, from
%                   which to accumulate the pixel information
%   pos_npixstart   Position (in bytes) from start of file of the start of the field npix
%   pos_pixstart    Position (in bytes) from start of file of the start of the field pix
%   npix_cumsum     Accumulated sum of number of pixels per bin across all the files
%   run_label       Indicates how to re-label the run index (pix(5,...)
%                       'fileno'        relabel run index as the index of the file in the list infiles
%                       'nochange'      use the run index as in the input file
%                        numeric array  offset run numbers for ith file by ith element of the array
%                   This option exists to deal with three limiting cases:
%                    (1) The run index is already written to the files correctly indexed into the header
%                       e.g. as when temporary files have been written during cut_sqw
%                    (2) There is one file per run, and the run index in the header block is the file
%                       index e.g. as in the creating of the master sqw file
%                    (3) The files correspond to several runs in general, which need to
%                       be offset to give the run indices into the collective list of run parameters
%
% As the result -- writes combined pixels block to the ouput sqw file.

% Write the pixel information to the file
%  The algorithm works as follows:
%       - Outer loop: deals with each of the bins in the grid for the output file in turn
%       - Inner loop: for each input file in turn, read the corresponding pixel information for that bin and then
%                     write to the output file
%  This is done because in general there is simply insufficient memory to hold the whole contents of all the files
%
%  We cannot read the number of pixels in each bin from all the individual input files, as we do not have enough
%  memory even for that, in general. We need to read these in, a section at a time, into a buffer.
% (For example, if 50^4 grid, 300 files then array size of npix= 8*300*50^4 = 15GB).
