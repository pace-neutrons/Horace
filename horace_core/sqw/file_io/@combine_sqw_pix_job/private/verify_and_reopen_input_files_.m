function fid = verify_and_reopen_input_files_(obj)
% reopens input files for reading or verify if these files are opened.
% Inputs:          (comes from protected obj.pix_comb_info_ field)
%  pix_comb_info    -- the class containing the information about the input
%                     files to combine, namely the fields:
%
%   infiles         Cell array of file names, or array of file identifiers of open files, from
%                   which to accumulate the pixel information
%   pos_npixstart   Position (in bytes) from start of file of the start of the field npix
%   pos_pixstart    Position (in bytes) from start of file of the start of the field pix
%   npix_cumsum     Accumulated sum of number of pixels per bin across all the files
%   run_label       Indicates how to re-label the run index (pix(5,...)
%                       'fileno'        relabel run index as the index of the file in the list infiles
%                       'nochange'      use the run index as in the input file
%                        numeric array  offset run numbers for ith file by ith element of the array
%                   This option exists to deal with three limiting cases:
%                    (1) The run index is already written to the files correctly indexed into the header
%                       e.g. as when temporary files have been written during cut_sqw
%                    (2) There is one file per run, and the run index in the header block is the file
%                       index e.g. as in the creating of the master sqw file
%                    (3) The files correspond to several runs in general, which need to
%                       be offset to give the run indices into the collective list of run parameters
%
% Output:
% fid            array of handles of files open for read operations.
% Throws SQW_FILE:runtime_error if files were not opened sucessfully
