% read bytes 3-7. Then we seek 2 (skipping over bytes 8 and 9) and read 5
% more bytes to get 10-15, and so on.

% This can be used to read ranges of bytes within a file:
%   >> data = cell(1, numel(read_sizes));
%   >> fid = fopen('mybinary_file', 'r');
%   >> for i = 1:numel(read_sizes)
%          fseek(fid, seek_sizes(i), 'cof');
