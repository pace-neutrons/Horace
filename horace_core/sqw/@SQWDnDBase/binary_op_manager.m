function w = binary_op_manager(w1, w2, binary_op)
% Implements a binary operation for objects with a signal and a variance array.
%
%   >> w = binary_op_manager(w1, w2, binary_op)
%
% All binary operations on Matlab double arrays are permitted
% (+, -, *, /, \) and are applied element by element to the signal and
% variance arrays.
%
% Input:
% ------
%   w1, w2      Objects on which the binary operation is to be performed.
%               One of these can be a Matlab double (i.e. double precision)
%               array, in which case the variance array is taken to be zero.
%
%               If w1, w2 are scalar objects with the same signal array sizes:
%               - The operation is performed element-by-element.
%
%               If one of w1 or w2 is a double array (and the other is a
%               scalar object):
%               - If a scalar, apply to each element of the object signal.
%               - If it is an array of the same size as the object signal
%                 array, apply the operation element by element.
%
%               If one or both of w1 and w2 are arrays of objects:
%               - If objects have same array sizes, the binary operation is
%                applied object element-by-object element.
%               - If one of the objects is scalar (i.e. only one object),
%                then it is applied by the binary operation to each object
%                in the other array.
%
%               If one of w1, w2 is an array of objects and the other is a
%               double array:
%               - If the double is a scalar, it is applied to every object
%                in the array.
%               - If the double is an array with the same size as the object
%                array, then each element is applied as a scalar to the
%                corresponding object in the object array.
%               - If the double is an array with larger size than the object
%                array, then the array is resolved into a stack of arrays,
%                where the stack has the same size as the object array, and
%                the each array in the stack is applied to the corresponding
%                object in the object array. [Note that for this operation
%                to be valid, each object must have the same signal array
%                size.]
%
%   binary_op   Function handle to a binary operation. All binary operations
%               on Matlab double or single arrays are permitted (+, -, *,
%               /, \).
%
% Output:
% -------
%   w           Output object or array of objects.
%
%
% NOTES:
% This is a generic method - works for any class (including sigvar)
% so long as the methods below are defined on that class.
%
% Requires that objects have the following methods to find the size of the
% public signal and variance arrays, create a sigvar object from those
% arrays, and set them from another sigvar object.
%
%	>> sz = sigvar_size(obj)    % Returns size of public signal and variance
%                               % arrays
%	>> w = sigvar(obj)          % Create a sigvar object from the public
%                               % signal and variance arrays
%	>> obj = sigvar_set(obj,w)  % Set signal and variance in an object from
%                               % those in a sigvar object
