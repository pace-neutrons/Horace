% Compute which of the quadrilaterals specified by xout/yout overlap the
% quadrilaterals specified by xin/yin, and the area of overlap
%
% Speed-up possible by using the routine intersection points, which is
% based on vectors, rather than the more tedious linear algebra approach.

sz=size(xin);%sz(2) gives us the number of input bins
%
%Initialise the output:
Area=zeros(1,sz(2));


%Work out if an input vertex is indside an output bin or not:
in=inpolygon(xin,yin,xout,yout);
inside=logical(in);

%==========
%At this point we can achieve a speed-up by noticing that if a given input
%bin is contained entirely within the output bin, then the overlap area will simply be
%the area of the input bin itself, which we have already calculated.

%inside is a 4-by-npix array.
totinside=sum(inside);
testinside=(totinside==4);%gives ones where an input bin is completely within an output bin
indinside=find(testinside);%gives the indices where this is the case
Area(indinside)=inarea(indinside);

%==========

%Work out the intersection co-ordinates for all 4
%sides of the input bin, and then work out which intersection co-ordinate lies
%on the line between the relevant output bin vertices.

%For each overlap polygon we now must pick a point and then, assuming our
%overlap shape is convex, calculate the polar angle to each of the other
%points. We then re-order them according to increasing polar angle so that
%we can use polyarea/shoelace algorithms. Notice that we do not bother with
%the calculation if there is no overlap, or if we have already worked out
%that the input bin is entirely within the output bin.

%===========
%Can probably achieve a significant speed-up by noticing that we do not
%need to calculate the intersection points for input bins that are fully
%inside the output bin
