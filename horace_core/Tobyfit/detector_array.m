function detectors = detector_array (wtmp, use_tubes)
% Get detector information from a single sqw object.
%
%   >> detectors = detector_array (wtmp, use_tubes)
%
% This is a function for temporary use until the transition to exclusively
% using IX_detector_array data in the experiment_info has been completed.
%
% Requires that each run in the sqw object has the same detpar structure or
% IX_detector_array
%
% Input:
% ------
%   wtmp        sqw object
%   use_tubes   Logical flag if detector information is not held in wtmp as an
%               IX_detector_array object in wtmp.experiment_info:
%               - true: use IX_det_He3tube with wall thickness 6.35e-4 m and 10
%                 atms 3He partial pressures alongside detpar data on detector
%                 sizes
%               - false: use IX_det_TobyfitClassic as detector type alongside
%                 detpar data data on detector sizes
%
% Output:
% -------
%   detectors   The single IX_detector_array object use for each of the runs


% Because detpar only contains minimal information, either hardwire in
% the detector type here or use the info now available in the detector
% arrays
