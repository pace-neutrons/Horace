%We can cheat here by making a dummy sqw function that returns the bose
%factor for all of the points:
sqw_bose=sqw_eval(win,@bose_factor,T);

% as bose and sqw_bose have the same pixels, and the same pixels
% coordinates, sorting pixels over bins are not necessary. This is why we
% set ignore_cell_sorting to true
wout = binary_op_manager(win,sqw_bose,@mtimes,true);
