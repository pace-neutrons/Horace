%   matlab_dirname      Version folder name for dll files to be used (e.g. _R2009a)
%                       If operating system unsupported by this function, returns ''
%   dll_extension       Extension of dll files (e.g. mexw64); defaults to .dll if enquiry fails.
%   os_dirname          Operating system folder name (e.g. _PCWIN)
%
% The convention for folder naming that has been adopted is that dll files are kept in e.g.
% ...\_PCWIN64\_R2009a\some_function.mexw64.

% to other folders containing .m files when a distribution is made from the subversion copy.
