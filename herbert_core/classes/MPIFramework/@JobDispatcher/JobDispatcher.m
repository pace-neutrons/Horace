classdef JobDispatcher
    % The class to run and control Herbert MPI jobs which are the children
    % of JobExecutor class.
    %
    % Allow user to run multi-session or MPI jobs, defined by the
    % child classes of the JobExecutor class.
    %
    % The parallel job is run on a Cluster, selected by parallel_config
    % configuration.
    %
    % JobDispatcher: Main properties and methods
    % ---------------------------------------------
    % Job Description and control properties:
    %
    % job_id         - String describing the current job
    % mess_framework - Instance of the file-based messages framework used
    %                  for communications with the cluster
    % cluster        - Read-only instance of a <a href="matlab:help('ClusterWrapper');">ClusterWrapper</a>
    %                  controlling a parallel job
    % is_initialized - true if jobDispatcher already controls a cluster.
    %
    % ---------------------------------------------
    % Job Timing:
    %
    % task_check_time - how often (in seconds) job dispatcher should query the task status
    % task_wait_time  - Short drop-out time (in seconds) for querying task status
    %
    % fail_limit      - number of times to try an action before deciding a
    %                   job has failed
    % time_to_fail    - time interval to wait until job which do not send
    %                   any messages from cluster is considered failed.
    %
    % ---------------------------------------------------------------------
    % JobDispatcher methods:
    %
    % start_job    - Start cluster and initialize parallel job to be executed
    %                by the cluster.
    % restart_job  - Restart parallel Matlab job started earlier by start_job
    % finalize_all - Stop cluster and parallel processes and clear all messages.
    %
    % Helpers:
    % display_fail_job_results - Auxiliary method to display job results
    %               if the job has failed.
    % split_tasks - Divide list of job parameters among given number of
    %               workers and generate list of init messages for the
    %               subtasks
    %
    properties(Dependent)
        % The string with running job id, i.e. the name, which describes
        % the job, and distinguishes it from any other jobs running
        % on a system. Normally, a folder with this name exists on a
