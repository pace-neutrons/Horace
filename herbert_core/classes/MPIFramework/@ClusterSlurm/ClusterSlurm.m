        %BF BOOT_FAIL   Job terminated due to launch failure, typically due to a hardware failure (e.g. unable to boot the node or block and the job can not be requeued).
        %CA CANCELLED   Job was explicitly cancelled by the user or system administrator. The job may or may not have been initiated.
        %CD COMPLETED   Job has terminated all processes on all nodes with an exit code of zero.
        %CF CONFIGURING Job has been allocated resources, but are waiting for them to become ready for use (e.g. booting).
        %CG COMPLETING  Job is in the process of completing. Some processes on some nodes may still be active.
        %DL DEADLINE    Job missed its deadline.
        %F FAILED       Job terminated with non-zero exit code or other failure condition.
        %NF NODE_FAIL   Job terminated due to failure of one or more allocated nodes.
        %PD PENDING     Job is awaiting resource allocation. Note for a job to be selected in this state it must have "EligibleTime" in the requested time interval or different from "Unknown". The "EligibleTime" is displayed by the "scontrol show job" command. For example jobs submitted with the "--hold" option will have "EligibleTime=Unknown" as they are pending indefinitely.
        %PR PREEMPTED   Job terminated due to preemption.
        %R RUNNING      Job currently has an allocation.
        %RS RESIZING    Job is about to change size.
        %S SUSPENDED    Job has an allocation, but execution has been suspended.
        %TO TIMEOUT     Job terminated upon reaching its time limit.
