% 1 -> object<->scalar 2-> object<->image and 3->object<->object
% 0 means operations can be performed by converting to sigvar.

% Inputs:
% op1_has_pix   -- true if operand 1 has pixels
% op1_has_img   -- true if operand 1 has image
% op2_has_pix   -- true if operand 2 has pixels
% op2_has_img   -- true if operand 2 has image
% Returns:
% number from -1 to 3, describing type of operation, performed
% over pixesl
