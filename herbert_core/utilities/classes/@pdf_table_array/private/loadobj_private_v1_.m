function obj = loadobj_private_v1_ (obj,S)
% Instantiate a scalar object from a scalar structure of class properties
%
%   >> obj = loadobj_private_ (S)
%
% Input:
% ------
%   S       Input structure (scalar)
%
% Output:
% -------
%   obj     Reconstructed object
%
% Backwards compatibility function. It must be able to instantiate from a
% - structure of independent class properties from the current class version
% - structure returned by the matlab intrinsic load function when reading
%   .mat files into which earlier versions of the object were saved
% - any other bespoke structures that were saved by earlier versions of the
%   class
%
% It is not designed to interpret the arguments passed to the current class
% constructor.
%
% Generally a class-specific function

% ----------------

nams = fieldnames(S);

% Assume the structure is of independent properties
for i=1:numel(nams)
    nam = nams{i};
    obj.(nam) = S.(nam);
