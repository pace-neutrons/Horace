function argout = ndgridcell(argin)
% Version of ndgrid with input and output arguments each a single cell array.
% Exactly the same as ndgrid except that the input argument is a single cell array
% of the input arguments, argin{1}=x1, argin{2}=x2 etc., and the output is a
% single cell array argout{1}=X1, argout{2}=X2 etc.
%
% The only difference is that the case of only one array in the input cell is
% not meaningless, because in ndgrid the number of output arguments is used to
% determine the sise of the output arrays.
%
% See the help for ndgrid for more details.
